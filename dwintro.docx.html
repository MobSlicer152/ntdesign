<h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>The <strong>NT OS/2</strong> system is a portable implementation of
OS/2 developed in a high-level language. The initial release of
<strong>NT OS/2</strong> is targeted for Intel 860-based hardware, which
includes both personal computers (<em>Frazzle</em>) and servers
(<em>Dazzle</em>).</p>
<p>The first systems based on a RISC microprocessor will be available
for testing in the fall of 1990.</p>
<h1 id="project-goals">2. Project Goals</h1>
<p>The ultimate goal of the <strong>NT OS/2</strong> project is to
develop a portable implementation of OS/2 executing on the Intel 860 and
to establish this combination of hardware and software as the standard
for high-performance personal computers and server systems.</p>
<p><strong>NT OS/2</strong> has the following overall project goals
(though not all these goals will be attained by the first implementation
of <strong>NT OS/2</strong>):</p>
<p>o Portability to a variety of hardware architectures. Though the
first implementation is targeted to the Intel 860, the overall system
design isolates the machine-dependent portions for portability to other
architectures.</p>
<p>o Support for multiple processors with shared memory via symmetric
multiprocessing. This provides performance improvements for
multiprocessor workstations and servers.</p>
<p>o Compatibility with the OS/2 V2.0 32-bit application programming
interface (API). Because the initial target system is not an Intel x86
architecture, all applications will have to be recompiled and relinked.
In addition, any assembly language code will have to be rewritten or
converted to a higher level language such as C.</p>
<p>o Security at the C2 level with future versions achieving higher
levels of security. This includes login/logout options on the personal
computer and the server system, and declaration and enforcement of
protection attributes for shareable resources (files, IPC, memory
objects, etc.).</p>
<p>o Support for a POSIX-compliant API interface that passes the POSIX
validation suites.</p>
<p>o Support for internationalization.</p>
<p>o Support for LANMAN networking and management of personal computers
and servers.</p>
<p>o Support for the current Presentation Manager API running in both
the OS/2 environment and the POSIX environment.</p>
<p>o Support for distributed applications. The network is integrated
into the system to allow transparent distribution of applications and
services within a network.</p>
<p>o Support for object-oriented file systems and object-oriented
presentation manager.</p>
<p>o Easy extensibility by layering new features on the existing system
without modifying the underlying system.</p>
<p>o Simultaneous execution by multiple users, each with a unique
security profile.</p>
<p>o Interoperability and data interchange between OS/2 and POSIX
applications.</p>
<p>o High reliability that prevents errant user programs from causing a
system crash or exhausting system-wide resources. Resource quotas, a
protected kernel, and protected objects are used to improve
reliability.</p>
<h1 id="nt-os2-components">3. NT OS/2 Components</h1>
<p><strong>NT OS/2</strong> consists of a highly integrated kernel /
executive that executes in kernel mode. It provides the necessary
services to allow the emulation of OS/2 and POSIX APIs via protected
subsystems executing in user mode. Both the OS/2 and POSIX subsystems
provide these services through remote procedure calls from a client to
the server subsystem. The server subsystem, in turn, emulates the
desired operation locally or by calling the executive, and returns the
results to the caller. The following diagram illustrates the structure
of <strong>NT OS/2</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="functional-specifications">4. Functional Specifications</h1>
<p>The following specifications are contained within this design
workbook. Each specification contains an abstract of the component it
describes, how that component fits into the system, the various APIs
that are used to access the functionality, and enough detail to ensure
the defined capability can be implemented.</p>
<p>The goal of the specifications is to allow someone to understand the
functionality provided by a particular piece of the system. It is NOT a
goal to describe the actual implementation.</p>
<p>Each specification addresses Cruiser and POSIX compatibility, if
appropriate. The following is a list of design specifications included
in this version of the workbook:</p>
<p>1. Kernel - Describes the function of the kernel, the objects
implemented, and the various interfaces provided to manipulate these
objects. This specification contains implementation details, where
necessary, to reveal how multiprocessing and processor dispatching take
place. This specification also describes synchronization,
scheduling/dispatching, and Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APCs).</p>
<p>2. Object Management - Describes how the executive deals with
objects, what they are for, how they are protected, how they are named,
how they are allocated, how they are accounted for, and how they are
deleted. This specification also addresses object directories and how to
access them using the file system directory operations.</p>
<p>3. Process Structure - Describes the process and thread objects and
the operations that can be performed on them. This specification also
explains signals and how OS/2 compatibility and POSIX compliance are

the condition dispatcher and the arguments that accompany each
exception. It also explains guard page handling, automatic stack
expansion, and access violations on the user stack, as well as how
signals are handled at the user level.</p>
<p>17. OS/2 Emulation Subsystem - Describes the requirements and methods
used to design and build the OS/2 emulation subsystem.</p>
<p>18. Status values - Describes the format for status values return by
<strong>NT OS/2</strong> APIs.</p>
<p>19. Subsystem Design Rational - Describes the rationale for designing
OS/2 and POSIX emulation as subsystems as opposed to supporting the APIs
directly in the executive.</p>
<p>20. Shared Resource Specification - Describes the routines that
implement multiple-readers, single-writer access to a share
resource.</p>
