<p>Create section headers by using the H1-H4 styles. You make a line a
header by typing Alt-H-n, where n is 1-4, when the cursor is anywhere
within the line. You don't need to make the header text bold; the style
does that for you. You can switch a paragraph back to normal by typing
either Alt-X-P or Alt-P-S.</p>
<p>The following text shows how to format various textual elements using
the SPEC style sheet. You should remove these examples.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>This specification describes the <strong>Windows NT</strong> routines
that implement multiple-readers, single-writer access to a shared
resource. Access is controlled via a shared resource variable and a set
of routines to acquire the resource for shared access (also commonly
known as read access) or to acquire the resource for exclusive access
(also called write access).</p>
<p>A resource is logically in one of three states:</p>
<p>o Acquired for shared access</p>
<p>o Acquired for exclusive access</p>
<p>o Released (i.e., not acquired for shared or exclusive access)</p>
<p>Initially a resource is in the released state, and can be acquired
for either shared or exclusive access by a user.</p>
<p>A resource that is acquired for shared access can be acquired by
other users for shared access. The resource stays in the acquired for
shared access state until all users that have acquired it have released
the resource, and then it becomes released. Each resource, internally,
maintains a count of the number of users granted shared access.</p>
<p>A resource that is acquired for exclusive access cannot be acquired
by other users until the single user that has acquired the resource for
exclusive access releases the resource. However, a thread can
recursively acquire exclusive access to the same resource without
blocking.</p>
<p>The routines described in this specification do not return to the
caller until the resource has been acquired. or the user has the option
of having the procedure return immediately to the caller if the resource
cannot be acquired with blocking. The procedure's return value then
indicates if the resource has been acquired.</p>
<p>To help avoid starvation of a user requesting exclusive access to a
resource, the procedures do not allow additional users shared access to
a resource if there is a user waiting for exclusive access to the
resource.</p>
<p>Also, when a user releases exclusive access to a resource, priority
is given to those waiting for exclusive access over those waiting for
shared access.</p>
<p>The <strong>APIs</strong> that implement a shared resource are the
following:</p>
<p><strong>ExInitializeResource</strong> - Initialize a resource and set
its state to released</p>
<p><strong>ExAcquireResourceShared</strong> - Acquire shared access to a
resource</p>
<p><strong>ExAcquireResourceExclusive</strong> - Acquire exclusive
access to a resource</p>
<p><strong>ExReleaseResource</strong> - Release a resource (shared or
exclusive)</p>
<p><strong>ExConvertSharedToExclusive</strong> - Convert from shared to
exclusive access</p>
<p><strong>ExConvertExclusiveToShared</strong> - Convert from exclusive
to shared access</p>
<p><strong>ExDeleteResource</strong> - Deletes (i.e., uninitializes) a
resource</p>
<h1 id="initializing-a-resource-variable">2. Initializing a Resource
Variable</h1>
<p>A resource variable can be initialized and its state set to released
with the <strong>ExInitializeResource</strong> procedure.</p>
<p><strong>VOID</strong></p>
<p><strong>ExInitializeResource</strong> (</p>
<p><strong>IN PERESOURCE</strong> <em>Resource</em></p>
<p>);</p>
<p><u>Parameters:</u></p>
<p><em>Resource</em> — A pointer to the resource variable being
initialized</p>
<p>A resource variable cannot be used by the other procedures until it
has been initialized.</p>
<h1 id="acquiring-a-resource-for-shared-access">3. Acquiring a Resource
for Shared Access</h1>
<p>A user can acquire shared access to a resource with the
<strong>ExAcquireResourceShared</strong> procedure.</p>
<p><strong>BOOLEAN</strong></p>
<p><strong>ExAcquireResourceShared</strong> (</p>
<p><strong>IN</strong> <strong>PERESOURCE</strong>
<em>Resource</em>,</p>
<p><strong>IN</strong> <strong>BOOLEAN</strong> <em>Wait</em></p>
<p>);</p>
<p><u>Parameters:</u></p>
<p><em>Resource</em> - A pointer to the resource variable to be acquired
for shared access</p>
<p><em>Wait</em> - Indicates if the call is allowed to block in order to
acquire the resource. A value of TRUE indicates that the call is allowed
to wait for the resource and FALSE indicates that control is to return
immediately even if the resource cannot be acquired.</p>
<p><u>Return Value:</u></p>
<p><em>BOOLEAN</em> - Returns TRUE if the access to the resource has
been acquired and FALSE otherwise. If the Wait input parameter is TRUE
then this function will always return a value of TRUE. If the Wait input
parameter is FALSE then this function will return TRUE if the resource
was acquired without blocking and FALSE if the resource cannot be
acquired without blocking.</p>
<p>If the Wait parameter is TRUE, then this procedure does not return to
the caller until the resource has been acquired for shared access. When
the user acquires the resource, the count of the number of shared access
users is incremented by one.</p>
<p>If the caller's thread has previously acquired exclusive access to
the resource then the call to <strong>ExAcquireResourceShared</strong>
will automatically succeed.</p>
<h1 id="acquiring-a-resource-for-exclusive-access">4. Acquiring a
Resource for Exclusive Access</h1>
<p>A user can acquire exclusive access to a resource with the
<strong>ExAcquireResourceExclusive</strong> procedure.</p>
<p><strong>BOOLEAN</strong></p>
<p><strong>ExAcquireResourceExclusive</strong> (</p>
<p><strong>IN</strong> <strong>PERESOURCE</strong>
<em>Resource</em>,</p>
<p><strong>IN</strong> <strong>BOOLEAN</strong> <em>Wait</em></p>
<p>);</p>
<p><u>Parameters:</u></p>
<p><em>Resource</em> - A pointer to the resource variable to be acquired
for exclusive access</p>
<p><em>Wait</em> - Indicates if the call is allowed to block in order to
acquire the resource. A value of TRUE indicates that the call is allowed
to wait for the resource and FALSE indicates that control is to return
immediately even if the resource cannot be acquired.</p>
<p><u>Return Value:</u></p>
<p><em>BOOLEAN</em> - Returns TRUE if the access to the resource has
been acquired and FALSE otherwise. If the Wait input parameter is TRUE
then this function will always return a value of TRUE. If the Wait input
parameter is FALSE then this function will return TRUE if the resource
was acquired without blocking and FALSE if the resource cannot be
acquired without blocking.</p>
<p>If the Wait parameter is TRUE, then this procedure does not return to
the caller until the resource has been acquired for exclusive
access.</p>
<p>If the caller's thread has previously acquired exclusive access to
the resource then subsequent calls to
<strong>ExAcquireResourceExclusive</strong> will automatically
succeed.</p>
<h1 id="releasing-a-resource">5. Releasing a Resource</h1>
<p>A user can release access to a resource with the
<strong>ExReleaseResource</strong> procedure. This procedure is for
releasing either exclusive access or shared access to a resource.</p>
<p><strong>VOID</strong></p>
<p><strong>ExReleaseResource</strong> (</p>
<p><strong>IN</strong> <strong>PERESOURCE</strong> <em>Resource</em></p>
<p>);</p>
<p><u>Parameters:</u></p>
<p><em>Resource</em> - A pointer to the resource variable to be
released</p>
<p>If the resource is acquired for shared access, the number of users
with shared access to the resource is decremented by one. If the count
is now zero, the resource is released and next user waiting for
exclusive access to the resource acquires it.</p>
<p>If the resource is acquired for exclusive access then the count of
the number of times it has been recursively acquired is decremented by
one. If the count is now zero, the resource is released and the next
user waiting for access to the resource acquires it.</p>
<h1 id="changing-from-shared-access-to-exclusive-access">6. Changing
from Shared Access to Exclusive Access</h1>
<p>A user that has shared access to a resource can change to exclusive
access with the <strong>ExConvertSharedToExclusive</strong>
procedure.</p>
<p><strong>VOID</strong></p>
<p><strong>ExConvertSharedToExclusive</strong> (</p>
<p><strong>IN</strong> <strong>PERESOURCE</strong> <em>Resource</em></p>
<p>);</p>
<p><u>Parameters:</u></p>
<p><em>Resource</em> - A pointer to the resource variable to be acquired
for exclusive access</p>
<p>This procedure does not return to the caller until the resource has
been acquired for exclusive access. This procedure is similar in
function to releasing a shared resource and then acquiring it for
exclusive access; however, in the case where only one user has the
resource acquired with shared access, the conversion to exclusive access
with <strong>ExConvertSharedToExclusive</strong> is more efficient.</p>
<p>It is an error to try to covert a resource to exclusive access that
is not currently acquired for either shared or exclusive access.</p>
<h1 id="changing-from-shared-access-to-exclusive-access-1">7. Changing
from Shared Access to Exclusive Access</h1>
<p>A user that has exclusive access to a resource can change to shared
access with the <strong>ExConvertExclusiveToShared</strong>
procedure.</p>
<p><strong>VOID</strong></p>
<p><strong>ExConvertExclusiveToShared</strong> (</p>
<p><strong>IN</strong> <strong>PERESOURCE</strong> <em>Resource</em></p>
<p>);</p>
<p><u>Parameters:</u></p>
<p><em>Resource</em> - A pointer to the resource variable to be
converted to shared access</p>
<p>This procedure does not return to the caller until the resource has
been acquired for shared access. This procedure is similar in function
to releasing an exclusive resource and then acquiring it for shared
access; however the user calling
<strong>ExConvertExclusiveToShared</strong> does not relinquish access
to the resource as the two step operation does.</p>
<p>It is an error to try to convert a resource to shared access that is
not currently acquired for exclusive access, or has been acquired
recusively.</p>
<h1 id="deleting-a-resource-variable">8. Deleting a Resource
Variable</h1>
<p>A resource variable can be deleted (i.e., uninitialized) with the
<strong>ExDeleteResource</strong> procedure.</p>
<p><strong>VOID</strong></p>
<p><strong>ExDeleteResource</strong> (</p>
<p><strong>IN PERESOURCE</strong> <em>Resource</em></p>
<p>);</p>
<p><u>Parameters:</u></p>
<p><em>Resource</em> — A pointer to the resource variable being
deleted</p>
<p>The programmer is responsible for ensuring that no one is actively
using the resource. After calling this procedure the resource cannot be
used again unless it is reinitialized.</p>
