<h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>This specification describes the <strong>Windows NT</strong> event
and semaphore objects and the wait services. A definition and an
explanation of operation is given for each API. No attempt has been
made, however, to fully explain all error conditions and their
consequences.</p>
<p>The APIs described include:</p>
<p><strong>NtCreateEvent</strong> - create event and open handle</p>
<p><strong>NtOpenEvent</strong> - open handle to existing event</p>
<p><strong>NtSetEvent</strong> - set event to Signal state</p>
<p><strong>NtResetEvent</strong> - set event to Not-Signaled state</p>
<p><strong>NtPulseEvent</strong> - set / reset event state
atomically</p>
<p><strong>NtQueryEvent</strong> - get information about event</p>
<p><strong>NtCreateSemaphore</strong> - create semaphore and open
handle</p>
<p><strong>NtOpenSemaphore</strong> - open handle to existing
semaphore</p>
<p><strong>NtReleaseSemaphore</strong> - release semaphore</p>
<p><strong>NtQuerySemaphore</strong> - get information about
semaphore</p>
<p><strong>NtWaitForSingleObject</strong> - wait for specified
object</p>
<p><strong>NtWaitForMultipleObjects</strong> - wait for a list of
objects</p>
<p><strong>NtDelayExecution</strong> - delay execution for the specified
time</p>
<p><strong>NtClose</strong> - close an object handle</p>
<h1 id="event-objects">2. Event Objects</h1>
<p>There are two types of event objects, <em>notification events</em>
and <em>synchronization events</em>. Notification event objects provide
a mechanism for notification. Notification events are either
<em>Signaled</em> (TRUE) or <em>Not</em>-<em>Signaled</em> (FALSE). An
event may be set multiple times, yet the state remains Signaled.
Notification events provides no ownership capability. If multiple
threads are waiting on a notification event, then when the event becomes
Signaled, <strong>all</strong> threads waiting for the event are made
"runnable". A notification event becomes Not-Signaled only when
explicitly reset.</p>
<p>Synchronization event objects have the property that when the event
is set, the event attains a state of Signaled, which releases a single
thread currently waiting on the event, and then the event immediately
attains a state of Not-Signaled. If there are no threads waiting on the
event, the state of the event remains Signaled. This allows threads to
"synchronize" on the signaling of the event. Like notification events,
synchronization events provide no ownership capability.</p>
<p>A synchronization event attains a state of Not-Signaled when
explicitly reset or when the first wait operation is satisfied on the
event. Note that any time an event attains a state of Not-Signaled, the
event count for the state of the event is set to zero.</p>
<h2 id="create-event-object">2.1 Create Event Object</h2>
<p>An event object is created and a handle opened for access to the
object with the <strong>NtCreateEvent</strong> function:</p>
<p><strong>NTSTATUS</strong></p>
<p><strong>NtCreateEvent</strong> (</p>
<p><strong>OUT PHANDLE</strong> <em>EventHandle,</em></p>
<p><strong>IN ULONG</strong> <em>DesiredAccess,</em></p>
<p><strong>IN POBJECT_ATTRIBUTES</strong> <em>ObjectAttributes</em>
<strong>OPTIONAL</strong><em>,</em></p>
<p><strong>IN EVENT_TYPE</strong> <em>EventType,</em></p>
<p><strong>IN BOOLEAN</strong> <em>InitialState</em></p>
<p>);</p>
<p><strong><u>Parameters:</u></strong></p>
<p><em>EventHandle</em> - A pointer to a variable that receives the
event object handle value.</p>
<p><em>DesiredAccess</em> - The desired types of access for the event.
The following object type specific access flags can be specified in
addition to the <em>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</em> flags described in the
Object Management Specification.</p>
<p>DesiredAccess Flags</p>
<p><em>EVENT_QUERY_STATE</em> - Query access to the event is
desired.</p>
<p><em>EVENT_MODIFY_STATE</em> - Modify state access (set and reset) to
the event is desired.</p>
<p><em>SYNCHRONIZE</em> - Synchronization access (wait) to the event is
desired.</p>
<p><em>ObjectAttributes</em> - An optional pointer to a structure that
specifies the object's attributes. Refer to the <em>Object Management
Specification</em> for details.</p>
<p><em>EventType</em> - The type of event object to be created. One of
<em>NotificationEvent</em> or <em>SynchronizationEvent</em>.</p>
<p><em>InitialState</em> - The initial state of the event object, one of
<em>TRUE</em> or <em>FALSE</em>. If the <em>InitialState</em> is
specified as TRUE, the event's current state value is set to one,
otherwise it is set to zero.</p>
<p>The <strong>NtCreateEvent</strong> function creates an event object
with the specified initial state. If an event is in the Signaled state
(TRUE), a wait operation on the event does not block. If the event is in
the Not-Signaled state (FALSE), a wait operation on the event blocks
until the specified event attains a state of Signaled, the timeout value
is exceeded, or an alert is delivered.</p>
<h2 id="open-event-object">2.2 Open Event Object</h2>
<p>A handle can be opened to an existing event object with the
<strong>NtOpenEvent</strong> function:</p>
<p><strong>NTSTATUS</strong></p>
<p><strong>NtOpenEvent</strong> <em>(</em></p>
<p><strong>OUT PHANDLE</strong> <em>EventHandle,</em></p>
<p><strong>IN ULONG</strong> <em>DesiredAccess,</em></p>
<p><strong>IN POBJECT_ATTRIBUTES</strong> <em>ObjectAttributes,</em></p>
<p><em>)</em>;</p>
<p><strong><u>Parameters:</u></strong></p>
<p><em>EventHandle</em> - A pointer to a variable that receives the
value of the event object handle value.</p>
<p><em>DesiredAccess</em> - The desired types of access to the event.
The following object type specific access flags can be specified in
addition to the <em>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</em> flags described in the
Object Management Specification.</p>
<p>DesiredAccess Flags</p>
<p><em>EVENT_QUERY_STATE</em> - Query access to the event is
desired.</p>
<p><em>EVENT_MODIFY_STATE</em> - Modify state access (set and reset) to
the event is desired.</p>
<p><em>SYNCHRONIZE</em> - Synchronization access (wait) to the event is
desired.</p>
<p><em>ObjectAttributes</em> - A pointer to a structure that specifies
the object's attributes. Refer to the <em>Object Management
Specification</em> for details.</p>
<h2 id="set-event">2.3 Set Event</h2>
<p>An event can be set to the signaled state (<em>TRUE</em>) with the
<strong>NtSetEvent</strong> function:</p>
<p><strong>NTSTATUS</strong></p>
<p><strong>NtSetEvent</strong> <em>(</em></p>
<p><strong>IN HANDLE</strong> <em>EventHandle,</em></p>
<p><strong>OUT PLONG</strong> <em>PreviousState</em>
<strong>OPTIONAL</strong></p>
<p><em>);</em></p>
<p><strong><u>Parameters:</u></strong></p>
<p><em>EventHandle</em> - An open handle to an event object.</p>
<p><em>PreviousState</em> - An optional pointer to a variable that
receives the previous state of the event. Zero is Not-Signaled, non-zero
is Signaled. The value indicates the number of times the event has been
set since the last reset.</p>
<p>Setting the event causes the event to attain a state of Signaled,
which releases all threads currently waiting on the event. Any threads
which issue a wait operation on the event do not block and continue to
execute. It also increments the event count for the state of the
event.</p>
<h2 id="reset-event">2.4 Reset Event</h2>
<p>The state of an event is set to the Not-Signaled state
(<em>FALSE</em>) using the <strong>NtResetEvent</strong> function:</p>
<p><strong>NTSTATUS</strong></p>
<p><strong>NtResetEvent</strong> <em>(</em></p>
<p><strong>IN HANDLE</strong> <em>EventHandle,</em></p>
<p><strong>OUT PLONG</strong> <em>PreviousState</em>
<strong>OPTIONAL</strong></p>
<p><em>);</em></p>
<p><strong><u>Parameters:</u></strong></p>
<p><em>EventHandle</em> - An open handle to an event object.</p>
<p><em>PreviousState</em> - An optional pointer to a variable that
receives the previous state of the event. Zero is Not-Signaled, non-zero
is Signaled. The value indicates the number of times the event has been
set since the last reset.</p>
<p>Once the event attains a state of Not-Signaled, any threads which
wait on the event block, awaiting the event to become Signaled. The
reset event service sets the event count to zero for the state of the
event.</p>
<h2 id="pulse-event">2.5 Pulse Event</h2>
<p>An event can be set to the Signaled state and reset to the
Not-Signaled state atomically with the <strong>NtPulseEvent</strong>
function:</p>
<p><strong>NTSTATUS</strong></p>
<p><strong>NtPulseEvent</strong> <em>(</em></p>
<p><strong>IN HANDLE</strong> <em>EventHandle,</em></p>
<p><strong>OUT PLONG</strong> <em>PreviousState</em>
<strong>OPTIONAL</strong></p>
<p><em>);</em></p>
<p><strong><u>Parameters:</u></strong></p>
<p><em>EventHandle</em> - An open handle to an event object.</p>
<p><em>PreviousState</em> - An optional pointer to a variable that
receives the previous state of the event. Zero is Not-Signaled, non-zero
is Signaled. The value indicates the number of times the event has been
set since the last reset.</p>
<p>Pulsing the event causes the event to attain a state of Signaled,
which releases all threads currently waiting on the event, and then
attain a state of Not-Signaled. The pulse event service sets the event
count to zero for the state of the event.</p>
<h2 id="query-event">2.6 Query Event</h2>
<p>The state of an event can be queried with the
<strong>NtQueryEvent</strong> function:</p>
<p><strong>NTSTATUS</strong></p>
<p><strong>NtQueryEvent</strong> <em>(</em></p>
<p><strong>IN HANDLE</strong> <em>EventHandle,</em></p>
<p><strong>IN EVENT_INFORMATION_CLASS</strong>
<em>EventInformationClass,</em></p>
<p><strong>OUT PVOID</strong> <em>EventInformation,</em></p>
<p><strong>IN ULONG</strong> <em>EventInformationLength,</em></p>
<p><strong>OUT PULONG</strong> <em>ReturnLength</em>
<strong>OPTIONAL</strong></p>
<p>);</p>
<p><strong><u>Parameters:</u></strong></p>
<p><em>EventHandle</em> - An open handle to an event object.</p>
<p><em>EventInformationClass</em> - The event information class about
which to retrieve information.</p>
<p><em>EventInformation</em> - A pointer to a buffer that receives the
specified information. The format and content of the buffer depend on
the specified event class.</p>
<p>EventInformation Format by Information Class:</p>
<p><em>EventBasicInformation</em> - Data type is
<em>EVENT_BASIC_INFORMATION</em>.</p>
<p>EVENT_BASIC_INFORMATION Structure</p>
<p><strong>EVENT_TYPE</strong> <em>EventType</em> - The type of the
event.</p>
<p><strong>LONG</strong> <em>EventState</em> - The current state of the
event.</p>
<p><em>EventInformationLength</em> - Specifies the length in bytes of
the event information buffer.</p>
<p><em>ReturnLength</em> - An optional pointer which, if specified,
receives the number of bytes placed in the event information buffer.</p>
<p>This function provides the capability to determine the state and
granted access of an event object.</p>
<h1 id="semaphore-objects">3. Semaphore Objects</h1>
<p>Semaphore objects provide a mechanism for resource gates. When a
semaphore is created, it is provided an initial count and maximum count.
When a thread waits on a semaphore, if the current count is greater than
zero, then the current count is decremented and the thread continues to
execute. If the current count is zero, the thread blocks until the count
becomes greater than zero. When a thread releases a semaphore, the
current count is augmented. Semaphores do not provide ownership;
multiple threads can be waiting and releasing the same semaphore.</p>
<h2 id="create-semaphore-object">3.1 Create Semaphore Object</h2>
<p>A semaphore object is created and a handle opened for access to the
object with the <strong>NtCreateSemaphore</strong> function:</p>
<p><strong>NTSTATUS</strong></p>
<p><strong>NtCreateSemaphore</strong> (</p>
<p><strong>OUT PHANDLE</strong> <em>SemaphoreHandle,</em></p>
<p><strong>IN ULONG</strong> <em>DesiredAccess,</em></p>
<p><strong>IN POBJECT_ATTRIBUTES</strong> <em>ObjectAttributes</em>
<strong>OPTIONAL</strong><em>,</em></p>
<p><strong>IN LONG</strong> <em>InitialCount,</em></p>
<p><strong>IN LONG</strong> <em>MaximumCount</em></p>
<p>);</p>
<p><strong><u>Parameters:</u></strong></p>
<p><em>SemaphoreHandle</em> - A pointer to a variable that receives the
value of the semaphore object handle.</p>
<p><em>DesiredAccess</em> - The desired types of access for the
semaphore. The following object type specific access flags can be
specified in addition to the <em>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</em> flags
described in the Object Management Specification.</p>
<p>DesiredAccess Flags</p>
<p><em>SEMAPHORE_QUERY_STATE</em> - Query access to the semaphore is
desired.</p>
<p><em>SEMAPHORE_MODIFY_STATE</em> - Modify state access (release) to
the semaphore is desired.</p>
<p><em>SYNCHRONIZE</em> - Synchronization access (wait) to the semaphore
is desired.</p>
<p><em>ObjectAttributes</em> - An optional pointer to a structure that
specifies the object's attributes. Refer to the <em>Object Management
Specification</em> for details.</p>
<p><em>InitialCount</em> - The initial count for the semaphore, this
value must be positive and less than or equal to the maximum count.</p>
<p><em>MaximumCount</em> - The maximum count for the semaphore, this
value must be greater than zero..</p>
<p>The <strong>NtCreateSemaphore</strong> function causes a semaphore
object to be created which contains the specified initial and maximum
counts.</p>
<h2 id="open-semaphore-object">3.2 Open Semaphore Object</h2>
<p>A handle can be opened to an existing semaphore object with the
<strong>NtOpenSemaphore</strong> function:</p>
<p><strong>NTSTATUS</strong></p>
<p><strong>NtOpenSemaphore</strong> <em>(</em></p>
<p><strong>OUT PHANDLE</strong> <em>SemaphoreHandle,</em></p>
<p><strong>IN ULONG</strong> <em>DesiredAccess,</em></p>
<p><strong>IN POBJECT_ATTRIBUTES</strong> <em>ObjectAttributes</em></p>
<p><em>)</em>;</p>
<p><strong><u>Parameters:</u></strong></p>
<p><em>SemaphoreHandle</em> - A pointer to a variable that receives the
semaphore object handle value.</p>
<p><em>DesiredAccess</em> - The desired types of access to the
semaphore. The following object type specific access flags can be
specified in addition to the <em>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</em> flags
described in the Object Management Specification.</p>
<p>DesiredAccess Flags</p>
<p><em>SEMAPHORE_QUERY_STATE</em> - Query access to the semaphore is
desired.</p>
<p><em>SEMAPHORE_MODIFY_STATE</em> - Modify state access (release) to
the semaphore is desired.</p>
<p><em>SYNCHRONIZE</em> - Synchronization access (wait) to the semaphore
is desired.</p>
<p><em>ObjectAttributes</em> - A pointer to a structure that specifies
the object's attributes. Refer to the <em>Object Management
Specification</em> for details.</p>

<strong>NtReleaseSemaphore</strong> function:</p>
<p><strong>NTSTATUS</strong></p>
<p><strong>NtReleaseSemaphore</strong> <em>(</em></p>
<p><strong>IN HANDLE</strong> <em>SemaphoreHandle,</em></p>
<p><strong>IN LONG</strong> <em>ReleaseCount,</em></p>

specified for the semaphore.</p>
<p><em>PreviousCount</em> - An optional pointer to a variable that
receives the previous count for the semaphore.</p>
<p>When the semaphore is released, the current count of the semaphore is
incremented by the <em>ReleaseCount</em>. Any threads that are waiting
for the semaphore are examined to see if the current semaphore value is
sufficient to satisfy their wait.</p>
<p>If the value specified by <em>ReleaseCount</em> would cause the
maximum count for the semaphore to be exceeded, then the count for the
semaphore is not affected and an error status is returned.</p>
<h2 id="query-semaphore">3.4 Query Semaphore</h2>
<p>The state of a semaphore can be queried with the
<strong>NtQuerySemaphore</strong> function:</p>
<p><strong>NTSTATUS</strong></p>
<p><strong>NtQuerySemaphore</strong> <em>(</em></p>
<p><strong>IN HANDLE</strong> <em>SemaphoreHandle,</em></p>
<p><strong>IN SEMAPHORE_INFORMATION_CLASS</strong>

of the semaphore information buffer.</p>
<p><em>ReturnLength</em> - An optional pointer which, if specified,
receives the number of bytes placed in the semaphore information
buffer.</p>
<p>This function provides the capability to determine the state and
granted access of a semaphore object</p>
<p><strong>4. Wait Services</strong></p>
<p><strong>Windows NT</strong> provides wait services for threads to use
for synchronization. A thread can wait on one or more objects to attain
a state of signaled, as follows:</p>
<p>o A thread can wait on a single waitable object.</p>
<p>o A thread can wait on any waitable object in a list of objects.</p>
<p>o A thread can wait on all waitable objects in a list of objects.</p>
<p>When a thread executes a wait service, it specifies through the
<em>Alertable</em> parameter whether or not alerts and
<strong>APC's</strong> should interrupt the wait. If an alert is
delivered while the thread is waiting with <em>Alertable</em>
<em>TRUE</em>, the wait service completes and a condition of
<em>STATUS_ALERTED</em> is raised. If an <strong>APC</strong> is
delivered while the thread is waiting with <em>Alertable</em>
<em>TRUE</em>, the <strong>APC</strong> is invoked and, when the APC
completes, the wait operation re-executed.</p>
<p>An optional <em>TimeOut</em> argument is supplied on the wait
services. If the <em>TimeOut</em> argument is not supplied, the wait
service completes when the wait conditions have been satisfied, or, when
the thread is alerted, if the wait specified alerts.</p>
<p>A <em>TimeOut</em> value is a signed 64 bit integer. If the
<em>TimeOut</em> value is positive, then the value is interpreted as an
absolute time and the wait expires when the system time equals the
specified absolute time. If the <em>TimeOut</em> value is negative, then
the absolute value of the <em>TimeOut</em> indicates the number of 100
nanosecond clock ticks to wait from the current time before completing
the wait with a time-out status.</p>
<p><strong>4.1 Wait For Single Object</strong></p>
<p>A wait operation on a waitable object is accomplished with the
<strong>NtWaitForSingleObject</strong> function:</p>
<p><strong>NTSTATUS</strong></p>
<p><strong>NtWaitForSingleObject</strong> <em>(</em></p>
<p><strong>IN HANDLE</strong> <em>Handle,</em></p>
<p><strong>IN BOOLEAN</strong> <em>Alertable,</em></p>
<p><strong>IN PTIME</strong> <em>TimeOut</em>
<strong>OPTIONAL</strong></p>
<p>);</p>
<p><strong><u>Parameters:</u></strong></p>
<p><em>Handle</em> - An open handle to a waitable object.</p>
<p><em>Alertable</em> - A boolean value that specifies whether the wait
is alertable.</p>
<p><em>TimeOut</em> - An optional pointer to a time-out value that
specifies the absolute or relative time over which the wait is to be
completed.</p>
<p>Waiting on an object checks the current state of the object. If the
current state of the object allows continued execution, any adjustments
to the object state are made (for example, decrementing the semaphore
count for a semaphore object) and the thread continues execution. If the
current state of the object does not allow continued execution, the
thread is placed into the wait state pending the change of the object's
state or time-out.</p>
<p>The returned status value indicates how the wait was satisfied:</p>
<p>o A value of <em>STATUS_TIME_OUT</em> indicates that the wait was
terminated due to the <em>TimeOut</em> conditions.</p>
<p>o A value of <em>STATUS_SUCCESS</em> indicates the specified object
attained a Signaled state thus completing the wait.</p>
<p>o A value of <em>STATUS_ABANDONED</em> indicates the specified object
attained a Signaled state but was abandoned.</p>
<p><strong>4.2 Wait for Multiple Objects</strong></p>
<p>A wait operation on multiple waitable objects (up to
<em>MAXIMUM_WAIT_OBJECTS)</em> is accomplished with the
<strong>NtWaitMultipleObjects</strong> function:</p>
<p><strong>NTSTATUS</strong></p>
<p><strong>NtWaitForMultipleObjects (</strong></p>
<p><strong>IN ULONG</strong> <em>Count,</em></p>
<p><strong>IN HANDLE</strong> <em>Handles[],</em></p>
<p><strong>IN WAIT_TYPE  </strong><em>WaitType,</em></p>
<p><strong>IN BOOLEAN</strong> <em>Alertable,</em></p>
<p><strong>IN PTIME</strong> <em>TimeOut</em>
<strong>OPTIONAL</strong></p>
<p>);</p>
<p><strong><u>Parameters:</u></strong></p>
<p><em>Count</em> - A count of the number of objects that are to be
waited on.</p>
<p><em>Handles</em> - An array of object handles.</p>
<p><em>WaitType</em> - The type of operation that is to be performed
(<em>WaitAny</em> or <em>WaitAll</em>).</p>
<p><em>Alertable</em> - A boolean value that specifies whether the wait
is alertable.</p>
<p><em>TimeOut</em> - An optional pointer to a time-out value that
specifies the absolute or relative time over which the wait is to be
completed.</p>
<p>The returned status value indicates how the wait was satisfied:</p>
<p>o A value of <em>STATUS_TIME_OUT</em> indicates that the wait was
terminated due to the <em>TimeOut</em> conditions.</p>
<p>o A value from 0 to <strong>MAXIMUM_WAIT_OBJECTS - 1</strong>,
indicates, in the case of wait for any object, the object number which
satisfied the wait. In the case of wait for all objects, the value only
indicates that the wait was completed successfully.</p>
<p>o A value from <em>STATUS_ABANDONED</em> to <em>STATUS_ABANDONED</em>
+ (<strong>MAXIMUM_WAIT_OBJECTS - 1</strong>), indicates, in the case of
wait for any object, the object number which satisfied the event, and
that the object which satisfied the event was abandoned. In the case of
wait for all objects, the value indicates that the wait was completed
successfully and at least one of the objects was abandoned.</p>
<h1 id="delay-execution">4.0 Delay Execution</h1>
<p>The execution of the current thread can be delayed for a specified
interval of time with the <strong>NtDelayExecution</strong>
function:</p>
<p><strong>NTSTATUS</strong></p>
<p><strong>NtDelayExecution</strong> (</p>
<p><strong>IN BOOLEAN</strong> <em>Alertable,</em></p>
<p><strong>IN PTIME</strong> <em>DelayInterval</em></p>
<p>);</p>
<p><strong><u>Parameters:</u></strong></p>
<p><em>Alertable</em> - A boolean value that specifies whether the wait
is alertable.</p>
<p><em>DelayInterval</em> - The absolute or relative time over which the
wait is to occur.</p>
<p>The <strong>NtDelayExecution</strong> function causes the current
thread to enter a waiting state until the specified interval of time has
passed. If <em>Alertable</em> is specified as <em>TRUE</em>, the wait
service completes and a condition of <em>STATUS_ALERTED</em> is raised.
If an <strong>APC</strong> is delivered while the thread is waiting
alertable, the <strong>APC</strong> is invoked and the wait operation
re-executed.</p>
<p><strong>5. Fast Interprocess Synchronization</strong></p>
<p>A general set of routines should be developed to provide extremely
fast synchronization primitives for a single process. These routines
could be utilized for medium and fine-grained parallel applications.</p>
<p>Basically a routine is called to allocate the "resource lock". The
resource lock consists of a data structure which has a "test and set"
variable, status variable, and a waitable object handle.</p>
<p>A request to gain the "lock" does a test and set on the resource lock
variable. If the resource lock is unowned, the thread continues to run.
If the resource lock is already owned, the thread sets the status
variable to indicate waiters are present, rechecks the lock variable,
and if not free, makes a system call to wait on the waitable object.
Note that for fine grained parallelism with multiprocessors it may be
desirable to "spin" on the lock for some period of time before doing the
wait.</p>
<p>A request to "unlock" does a test and set on the lock variable,
clearing the ownership. If the status variable indicates that waiters
are present, the waitable object is "signaled", thereby allowing any
waiters to compete for the lock.</p>
<p>In the typical case, a lock request would succeed without blocking
and the same for the unlock request. It is only when there is contention
on the lock that a call to the system has to be made.</p>
