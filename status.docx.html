<h1 id="overview">1. Overview</h1>
<p>This specification describes the purpose, structure, and use of
status codes for the <strong>Windows NT</strong> system.</p>
<p>In its simplest form, a <em>status code</em> is a value that is used
to indicate whether an operation was successfully completed. If this
were its only purpose, however, then all functions that returned a
status indicator might simply return a boolean value of TRUE or FALSE.
One of the values would indicate that the operation was successful, and
the other would indicate that something went wrong. Which value was
assigned which meaning would probably be arbitrary.</p>
<p>Systems today do not generally take this oversimplified approach when
dealing with success and failure. Most systems are at least concerned
with why a function incurred an error. Hence, systems generally have a
"success" code, indicating that everything worked properly, and multiple
failure codes, each indicating that an error occurred as well as
providing some hint or clue as to what went wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Windows NT</strong> takes this concept one step further and
adds multiple success codes as well as multiple error codes. This allows
the system to provide more information about what actually happened,
rather than simply indicate that the function worked. For example,
rather than just returning "success" with reason information, an
<em>information</em> status code may be used. Likewise, rather than just
returning "error" with reason information associated with it,
<strong>Windows NT</strong> provides the ability to express a
<em>warning</em> as well.</p>
<p>These types of status codes do not adversely affect the efficiency of
the system; rather, they provide robustness. A programmer can still ask
the basic question, "Was the function successful or not?"</p>
<p><strong>Windows NT</strong> provides a common architecture for its
status codes, which it uses throughout the native part of the system.
That is, all functions that return status return the same type of status
code. This common treatment of status values makes them easy to use and
easy to understand.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>Windows NT</strong> provides a mechanism to allow
status codes to be local to a given <em>facility</em>, such as the
kernel or the Session Manager. That is, each component has a separate
<em>facility code</em>. In this way, message codes used by one facility
will not be confused with codes used by another facility.</p>
<p>Having different facility codes also provides more useful information
to the caller when it is important to determine exactly which part of
the system encountered an error. For example, if the C runtime library
incurs an error when opening a file, was it the runtime library itself
that incurred the error, a subsystem that the runtime called, the
operating system, the file system, or a disk driver? This information is
sometimes important.</p>

on the same page as the diagram. If repagination occurs and this happens
automatically, remove the extra PS.</p>
<h1 id="definition">2. Definition</h1>
<p>A status code in <strong>Windows NT</strong> contains four fields.
The following is the format of a status code:</p>
<p>3 3 2 2 1 1</p>
<p>1 0 9 8 6 5 0</p>
<p>┌───┬─┬───────────────────┬──────────────────────┐</p>
<p>│ <strong>S</strong> │<strong>C</strong>│ <strong>Facility</strong> │
<strong>Code</strong> │</p>
<p>└───┴─┴───────────────────┴──────────────────────┘</p>
<p>where:</p>
<p><strong>S</strong> ——<em>Severity</em> field. This field represents
the severity of the status code. The following values are defined:</p>
<p><strong>00</strong> ——<em>Success</em>. This value means that the
function was successful.</p>
<p><strong>01</strong> ——<em>Information</em>. This value means that the
function was successful and additional information about what happened
is supplied.</p>
<p><strong>10</strong> ——<em>Warning</em>. This value means that the
function incurred an error that was not necessarily fatal.</p>
<p><strong>11</strong> ——<em>Error</em>. This value means that the
function incurred an error.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> ——<em>Customer</em> field. This field is reserved
to customers of Microsoft Corporation to allow them to define their own
facility codes.</p>
<p><strong>Facility</strong> ——<em>Facility</em> field. This field
indicates the facility from which the status code was issued.</p>
<p><strong>Code</strong> ——<em>Code</em> field. This field describes
what actually took place.</p>
<p>All system-defined status codes are defined in the file
<em>NTSTATUS.H</em>. Each status code has the format
<strong>STATUS_xxx</strong>, where <strong>xxx</strong> is a short
identifier that describes the meaning of the code. For example, the
status code <strong>STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW</strong> indicates, as the
name suggests, that an overflow occurred while writing a buffer. Names
are chosen to be as descriptive as possible, making source code easier
to read.</p>
<h1 id="use-of-status-codes">3. Use of Status Codes</h1>
<p>Status codes in <strong>Windows NT</strong> are used throughout the
system. They are returned by all system services to indicate whether the
service completed successfully. In some cases, the service returns an
alternate success code. That is, rather than return
<em>STATUS_SUCCESS</em>, the normal success status code, another code
may be used. An example of this is an I/O service that returns
<em>STATUS_PENDING</em>. This indicates that the request was
successfully made to the system, but it has not yet completed. While
this code indicates that the request was successful, it also provides
pertinent information about exactly what was successful.</p>
<p>All library routines in <strong>Windows NT</strong> that can return a
success indicator also use status codes. They return status codes in the
same format as the rest of the system.</p>
<p>Status codes may also be used in a call to the
<strong>NtRaiseException</strong> service, provided the status code
represents a warning or error. Information and success codes may not be
raised. It should also be noted that if a warning status is raised, and
no exception handler handles the exception, the default action is to
<em>continue</em>. The default action for an unhandled error condition,
however, is to terminate the thread. For more information, see the
<em>Windows NT Exception Handling Specification</em>.</p>
<p>The following is an example utilization of the various types of
status codes in a common search utility. For example, the following
status codes might be used to indicate various completion statuses:</p>
<p>o <em>STATUS_SUCCESS</em> ——This code, a <em>SUCCESS</em> code, might
be used to indicate that all matches were successfully located and
displayed.</p>
<p>o <em><span class="smallcaps">STATUS_NO_MATCHES</span></em> ——This
code, an <em>INFORMATION</em> code, might be used to indicate that while
no errors occurred, no strings were located that matched the search
pattern string.</p>
<p>o <em>STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW</em> ——This code, a <em>WARNING</em>
code, might be used to indicate that while a match was found, a buffer
overflow occurred and the entire matching string could not be displayed.
Notice that this is certainly a problem from which the utility can
recover and therefore should not terminate the search.</p>
<p>o <em>STATUS_FILE_NOT_FOUND</em> ——This code, an <em>ERROR</em> code,
might be used to indicate that no files were found on which to perform
the search. This is not a recoverable error condition. The program can
do nothing but terminate.</p>
<h1 id="programming-interfaces">4. Programming Interfaces</h1>
<p><strong>Windows NT</strong> provides the following services and C
language macros to use with status codes:</p>
<p><strong>NtQueryStatusCode</strong> ——Return text associated with a
specified status code.</p>
<p><strong>SUCCESS</strong> ——Return boolean value based on success or
failure.</p>
<p><strong>IS_SUCCESS</strong> ——Return boolean TRUE if status code
severity is success.</p>
<p><strong>IS_INFORMATION</strong> ——Return boolean TRUE if status code
severity is information.</p>
<p><strong>IS_WARNING</strong> ——Return boolean TRUE if status code
severity is warning.</p>
<p><strong>IS_ERROR</strong> ——Return boolean TRUE if status code
severity is error.</p>
<p><strong>FACILITY</strong> ——Returns the facility code associated with
a status value.</p>
<h2 id="obtaining-information-for-status-codes">4.1 Obtaining
Information for Status Codes</h2>
<p>The message text associated with a status code may be obtained using
the <strong>NtQueryStatusCode</strong> service:</p>
<p><strong>NTSTATUS</strong></p>
<p><strong>NtQueryStatusCode (</strong></p>
<p><strong>IN NTSTATUS</strong> <em>StatusCode,</em></p>
<p><strong>OUT PVOID</strong> <em>MessageBuffer,</em></p>
<p><strong>IN ULONG</strong> <em>MessageLength,</em></p>
<p><strong>OUT PULONG</strong> <em>MessageReturnLength</em>
<strong>OPTIONAL,</strong></p>
<p><strong>OUT PSEVERITY</strong> <em>SeverityLevel,</em></p>
<p><strong>OUT PVOID</strong> <em>FacilityBuffer</em>
<strong>OPTIONAL,</strong></p>
<p><strong>IN ULONG</strong> <em>FacilityLength</em>
<strong>OPTIONAL,</strong></p>
<p><strong>OUT PULONG</strong> <em>FacilityReturnLength</em>
<strong>OPTIONAL</strong></p>
<p><strong>);</strong></p>
<p><u>Parameters:</u></p>
<p><em>StatusCode</em> ——Supplies the status code value whose associated
text should be returned.</p>
<p><em>MessageBuffer</em> ——Supplies a buffer into which the text for
the status code is stored.</p>
<p><em>MessageLength</em> ——Supplies the number of bytes in the
<em>MessageBuffer</em>.</p>
<p><em>MessageReturnLength</em> ——Optionally supplies a variable in
which to return the length of the text that was written into
<em>MessageBuffer</em>.</p>
<p><em>SeverityLevel</em> ——Supplies a pointer to a variable that is to
receive an enumerated type code representing the severity of the status
code.</p>
<p>SeverityLevel Values</p>
<p><em>Success</em> ——Indicates that the severity of <em>StatusCode</em>
is SUCCESS.</p>
<p><em>Information</em> ——Indicates that the severity of
<em>StatusCode</em> is INFORMATION.</p>
<p><em>Warning</em> ——Indicates that the severity of <em>StatusCode</em>
is WARNING.</p>
<p><em>Error</em> ——Indicates that the severity of <em>StatusCode</em>
is ERROR.</p>
<p><em>FacilityBuffer</em> ——Optionally supplies a buffer into which the
facility name associated with the status code is written.</p>
<p><em>FacilityLength</em> ——Optionally supplies the length of the
<em>FacilityBuffer</em>. If the <em>FacilityBuffer</em> parameter is
supplied, then this parameter must also be supplied.</p>
<p><em>FacilityReturnLength</em> ——Optionally supplies a variable in
which to return the length of the text that was written into
<em>FacilityBuffer</em>.</p>
<p>The <strong>NtQueryStatusCode</strong> service fetches the text
associated with a specified status code and writes it into the supplied
buffer. This allows programs to output explicit information about what
happened during the execution of a function.</p>
<p>If no message text can be found for the specified status code, then
the message text buffer will be set to the string, "NO MESSAGE TEXT",
and an information status code of <em>STATUS_NO_MESSAGE</em> is
returned. Likewise, if no text for the facility of the specified status
code can be located, the string, "NOFACILITY", is written to the
facility buffer, if one was supplied. If the country code of the process
is non-English, the message text appears in the designated language.</p>
<p>The message text for all status codes defined for <strong>Windows
NT</strong> can be obtained using the <strong>NtQueryStatusCode</strong>
service. Text for user-defined status codes can also be obtained
provided that the codes and text have been "added" to the system. For
more information, see the <em>Windows NT Status Code Design
Note</em>.</p>
