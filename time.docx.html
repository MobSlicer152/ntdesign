<p>Create section headers by using the H1-H4 styles. You make a line a
header by typing Alt-H-n, where n is 1-4, when the cursor is anywhere
within the line. You don't need to make the header text bold; the style
does that for you. You can switch a paragraph back to normal by typing
either Alt-X-P or Alt-P-S.</p>
<p>The following text shows how to format various textual elements using
the SPEC style sheet. You should remove these examples.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>This specification describes the <strong>NT</strong>
<strong>OS/2</strong> routines that implement absolute time conversion.
Time, in <strong>NT</strong> <strong>OS/2</strong>, is expressed as a
64-bit signed large integer value with 100ns resolution and contained in
variables of type <strong>TIME</strong>. Absolute times, such as August
29, 1989 at 11:08:30.245, are expressed as positive values (excluding
zero), while time intervals (e.g., 1 hour and 20 minutes) are expressed
as negative values (including zero).</p>
<p>The routines described in this document deal with absolute time and
converting from a value of type <strong>TIME</strong> to a structure
representing year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond,
and back again. They do not address the manipulation of time intervals
or time zones. Time interval manipulation is simply done using large
integer arithmetic, and the time zone issue is beyond the realm of the
package.</p>
<p>Though <strong>NT OS/2</strong> time has a 100ns resolution, the
routines described here have only a one millisecond resolution. Time
precision smaller than a millisecond is either ignored or lost by these
routines.</p>
<p>The basis for <strong>NT OS/2</strong> time is the beginning of the
year 1601 AD, which is chosen because 1601 AD is the start of a new
quadricentury. The algorithms used in this package are based on the
Gregorian calendar.</p>
<p>The structure <strong>TIME_FIELDS</strong> is used to represent a
time value divided into its logical components. The declaration for
<strong>TIME_FIELDS</strong> is the following:</p>
<p><strong>typedef</strong> <strong>struct</strong>
<strong>_TIME_FIELDS</strong> {</p>
<p><strong>CSHORT</strong> <em>Year</em>;</p>
<p><strong>CSHORT</strong> <em>Month</em>;</p>
<p><strong>CSHORT</strong> <em>Day</em>;</p>
<p><strong>CSHORT</strong> <em>Hour</em>;</p>
<p><strong>CSHORT</strong> <em>Minute</em>;</p>
<p><strong>CSHORT</strong> <em>Second</em>;</p>
<p><strong>CSHORT</strong> <em>Milliseconds</em>;</p>
<p><strong>CSHORT</strong> <em>Weekday</em>;</p>
<p>} <strong>TIME_FIELDS</strong>;</p>
<p>where:</p>
<p><em>Year</em> - Denotes the year in a range between 1601 AD to around
30000 AD.</p>
<p><em>Month</em> - Denotes the month in a range between 1 (January) to
12 (December).</p>
<p><em>Day</em> - Denotes the day in the month with a range between 1 to
either 28, 29, 30, or 31, depending on the month and the year.</p>
<p><em>Hour</em> - Denotes the hour, on a 24 hour clock, in a range
between 0 and 23.</p>
<p><em>Minute</em> - Denotes the minute in a range between 0 and 59.</p>
<p><em>Second</em> - Denotes the second in a range between 0 to either
59 or 60, where 60 denotes a leap second.</p>
<p><em>Milliseconds</em> - Denotes the fraction of a second in a range
between 0 and 999.</p>
<p><em>Weekday</em> - Denotes the day of the week represented by the
rest of the time fields in a range between 0 (Sunday) and 6 (Saturday).
This field is only used when translating a 64-bit time value into a time
field structure and not when mapping the other direction.</p>
<p>In addition to providing routines to convert between
<strong>TIME</strong> and a <strong>TIME_FIELDS</strong> structure, this
package also provides routines that convert between
<strong>TIME</strong> and <strong>OS/2</strong> time and
<strong>POSIX</strong> time. <strong>OS/2</strong> time is expressed as
the number of seconds since the start of 1980. <strong>POSIX</strong>
time is the number of seconds since the start of 1970.</p>
<p>The <strong>APIs</strong> that implement time conversion are the
following:</p>
<p><strong>RtlTimeToTimeFields</strong> - Converts a
<strong>TIME</strong> value to a <strong>TIME_FIELDS</strong>
structure.</p>
<p><strong>RtlTimeFieldsToTime</strong> - Converts a
<strong>TIME_FIELDS</strong> structure to a <strong>TIME</strong>
value.</p>
<p><strong>RtlTimeToSecondsSince1980</strong> - Converts a
<strong>TIME</strong> value to seconds with a 1980 base.</p>
<p><strong>RtlSecondsSince1980ToTime</strong> - Converts seconds with a
1980 base to a <strong>TIME</strong> value.</p>
<p><strong>RtlTimeToSecondsSince1970</strong> - Converts a
<strong>TIME</strong> value to seconds with a 1970 base.</p>
<p><strong>RtlSecondsSince1970ToTime</strong> - Converts seconds with a
1970 base to a <strong>TIME</strong> value.</p>
<h1 id="converting-from-time-to-time_fields">2. Converting From TIME to
TIME_FIELDS</h1>
<p>A <strong>TIME</strong> value is converted to a corresponding
<strong>TIME_FIELDS</strong> structure with the
<strong>RtlTimeToTimeFields</strong> procedure.</p>
<p><strong>VOID</strong></p>
<p><strong>RtlTimeToTimeFields</strong> (</p>
<p><strong>IN</strong> <strong>PTIME</strong> <em>Time</em>,</p>
<p><strong>OUT</strong> <strong>PTIME_FIELDS</strong>
<em>TimeFields</em></p>
<p>);</p>
<p><u>Parameters:</u></p>
<p><em>Time</em> - Supplies the value being converted</p>
<p><em>TimeFields</em> - A pointer to the variable being set</p>
<p>The input time can be any non-negative large integer value and is
interpreted as the number of 100ns tics since the start of 1601 AD. The
resulting TimeFields variable will never contain a leap second value of
60.</p>
<h1 id="converting-from-time_fields-to-time">3. Converting From
TIME_FIELDS to TIME</h1>
<p>A <strong>TIME_FIELDS</strong> structure is converted to a
corresponding <strong>TIME</strong> value with the
<strong>RtlTimeFieldsToTime</strong> procedure.</p>
<p><strong>BOOLEAN</strong></p>
<p><strong>RtlTimeFieldsToTime</strong> (</p>
<p><strong>IN</strong> <strong>PTIME_FIELDS</strong>
<em>TimeFields</em>,</p>
<p><strong>OUT</strong> <strong>PTIME</strong> <em>Time</em></p>
<p>);</p>
<p><u>Parameters:</u></p>
<p><em>TimeFields</em> - Supplies the time field structure initialized
by the caller to convert to a time value</p>
<p><em>Time</em> - A pointer to the variable being set</p>
<p>The function result is TRUE if the input time fields is well formed
and is expressible by a time variable and FALSE otherwise.</p>
<p>The input time must be well formed (i.e., the year must be 1601 or
later, month must be between 1 and 12, day must be between 1 and the
maximum day for the given month and year, hour must be between 0 and 23,
minute must be between 0 and 59, second must be between 0 and 60 where
the value 60 is only allowed during the last time in a month, and
milliseconds must be between 0 and 999). The Weekday field is ignored by
this procedure.</p>
<h1 id="converting-from-time-to-os2-based-time">4. Converting From TIME

expressible by the output value [1980 to 2115] and otherwise FALSE.</p>
