<h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to define the semantic contents of an
I/O Request Packet (IRP). The information contained here is intended for
use mainly by Device Driver and File System developers. The I/O system
sends to the various Device Drivers<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> a stream of multiple
IRPs that the drivers must interpret and respond to. Figure 1 shows the
relationship between the device driver and the I/O system. Communication
between the I/O system and the Device Driver is through IRPs. This
chapter concentrates on the IRP language.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>+--------+ +--------+ +--------+<br />
| | | | | |<br />
| User | NtCall | I/O | Irp | Device |<br />
| |----------&gt;| System |----------&gt;| Driver |<br />
| | | | | |<br />
+--------+ +--------+ +--------+<br />
<br />
Figure 1<br />
Logical control flow from user to Device Driver</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each IRP has a well defined format and semantic meaning, and the
order in which they are sent must adhere to certain rules. The ordering
of IRPs and responses form a context sensitive language.</p>
<p>Each IRP contains a common header section followed by one or more
function specific records (also called IRP stack locations). From a
Device Drivers viewpoint each IRP request is a single record describing
one function to perform. That is, the drivers only interpret one
function specific record. The additional stack locations are for use
when a driver issues subsequent IRPs to a lower level driver and wishes
to reuse the original IRP.</p>
<p>Each IRP function is identified by a major and minor function field
in the IRP stack location record. The list of possible function
combinations are listed below. Each line lists a major function code
followed (in paranthesis) by a minor function code. Note that some major
functions (e.g., CREATE) do not make use the minor function field.</p>

<p>/* We need to define the minor function codes for the configuration,
device, and internal device function codes. */</p>
<p>Each Device Driver will only receive a combination of the preceding
function codes based on the drivers device type. This means that a file
system device driver can expect to receive different functions than the
keyboard device driver, or a disk driver. The possible device driver
types are:</p>
<p>Disk Driver,<br />
File System (including network redirector),<br />
Keyboard Driver,<br />
Mouse Driver,<br />
Network Drivers,<br />
Sound Driver,<br />
Tape Driver,<br />
Terminal Driver, and<br />
Video Driver,</p>
<p>/* We will need to futher expand on the different network device
drivers */</p>
<p>The remainder of this chapter describes the valid combination of IRP
function codes that each different device driver can expect to receive.
This is followed by a section listing every IRP function code along with
a description of the function's parameters, semantics, and I/O
completion status codes.</p>

3. IRP Function Descriptions</h1>
<p>This section describes the input parameters and semantics for each
IRP function code. It also discusses the interactions between the
parameters and lists possible return status codes.</p>
<p>The parameter descriptions list all the fields that are used within
the IRP by the operation being described. Each parameter is either Read
(i.e., used as input to the operation), Set (i.e., used as output for
the operation), or Ignored. To help distinguish the parameters we will
also use the two terms IrpFlags and FunctionFlags to denote the flags
field of the IRP header and the I/O stack location respectively.</p>
<p>In the description of the return status codes we do not include
generic values such as STATUS_PENDING or STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER which
can be returned for any IRP. We also do not describe values that can be
returned by a lower level device drivers such as
STATUS_PARITY_ERROR.</p>
<h2 id="close">3.1 Close</h2>
<p>The close function is used to close a previously opened file or
directory. Its two input parameters are a device object and an IRP. The
device object parameter points to a volume previously mounted by the
Device Driver and is where the file opened file exists. The IRP contains
the close function parameters (and are listed below).</p>
<p>Besides closing the file, this function will optionally deletes the
file based upon the disposition specified by the caller (See the
SET_INFORMATION operation). If this is the last file object with the
file opened and the disposition is <em>delete on close</em> then the
file is removed from the on-disk structure.</p>

<br />
The I/O structures after a mount operation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the preceding figure the newly allocated device object has
immediately following it a Device Driver private data record that is for
used only by the driver. This technique should be used in the driver to
keep track of the VPB and the device object where it is to send its read
and write requests. It should also be used to link together all of the
mounted volumes serviced by the driver.</p>
<p><u>Remounting a volume</u>:</p>
<p>By using the device driver private data record to maintain a link of
all mounted volumes a Device Driver can determine if a mount request for
a volume matches a previously mounted volume (They match if the both
volume have the same serial number and volume label). The following
figure shows the major I/O structure after processing a remount.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>+---------------+&lt;-------+<br />

<br />
The I/O structures after a remount operation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The remount operation does not allocate any new structures, instead
it it performs the following operations:</p>
<p>o The Device Drivers Private Data pointer to the target device object
is changed to point to the new target device object.</p>
<p>o The RealDevice field of the Vpb that we previously mounted is set
to the RealDevice field of the new Vpb that was passed in as a parameter
in the IRP.</p>
<p>o The Irp-&gt;Vpb is deallocated from pool by the device driver, and
complete the mount request with STATUS_SUCCESS.</p>
