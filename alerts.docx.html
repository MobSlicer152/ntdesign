<p><em>Revision 1.2, March 30, 1989</em></p>
<p>This design note discusses a proposal to implement alerts in both
kernel and user mode. The alert capability can be used to interrupt
thread execution in either processor mode at well defined points. A
companion design note on <strong>APC</strong>'s contains information and
algorithms that are pertinent to this design.</p>
<p>There are three alert specific kernel services;
<em>TestAlertThread</em>, <em>AlertThread</em>, and
<em>AlertResumeThread</em>. In addition, the kernel <em>Wait</em>
functions take a mode and an alertable flag as arguments.</p>
<p>Each thread has an alerted flag for each of the processor modes user
and kernel. These flags are set by calling the AlertThread function and
specifying the thread and the mode which are to be alerted.</p>
<p>If AlertThread is called and the target thread is in a wait state,
then several additional tests are performed to determine the correct
action to take.</p>
<p>If the mode of the wait is user, the alertable flag is set, and the
alert mode is user, then a thread specific <strong>APC</strong> is
queued to user mode which will raise the condition "alerted", the user
<strong>APC</strong> pending flag is set, and the thread is unwaited
with a completion status of "alerted".</p>
<p>If the mode of the wait is kernel or user, the alertable flag is set,
and the alert mode is kernel, then the thread is unwaited with a status
of "alerted". There is no <strong>APC</strong> queued for kernel
mode.</p>
<p>The following pseudo code describes the logic of AlertThread:</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE</strong> AlertThread (</p>
<p><strong>IN</strong> Mode : KtProcessorMode;</p>
<p><strong>IN</strong> Tcb : <strong>POINTER</strong> KtThread;</p>
<p>);</p>
<p><strong>BEGIN</strong></p>
<p>Acquire dispatcher database lock;</p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Tcb.State == Waiting <strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Tcb.WaitMode &gt;= Mode <strong>AND</strong>
Tcb.Alertable <strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Mode == User <strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p>Queue Tcb.AlertAcb;</p>
<p>Tcb.UserApcPending = True;</p>
<p><strong>END IF</strong>;</p>
<p>Unwait thread with a status of Alerted;</p>
<p><strong>ELSE</strong></p>
<p>Tcb.Alerted[Mode] = True;</p>
<p><strong>END IF;</strong></p>
<p><strong>ELSE</strong></p>
<p>Tcb.Alerted[Mode] = True;</p>
<p><strong>END IF</strong>;</p>
<p>Release dispatcher database lock;</p>
<p><strong>END</strong> AlertThread;</p>
<p>When the user mode alerted flag gets set, it remains set until either
a TestAlert or a Wait alertable is performed which clears the flag.</p>
<p>The kernel mode alerted flag is treated somewhat differently in that
it is cleared on each system service entry to the system. The reasoning
behind this is that a kernel mode alert should only persist for the
duration of time that execution continues in kernel mode. As soon as
execution leaves kernel mode, the alerted flag is no longer significant.
This is a very important feature which allows the conditional aborting
of native system services by protected subsystems which provide system
services for other operating system <strong>API's</strong>. This subject
is discussed in more detail at the end of this document.</p>
<p>The kernel service <em>AlertResumeThread</em> allows a thread to be
alerted and then resumed in a single operation. This operation is really
a kernel mode AlertThread followed by a ResumeThread, but is provided as
a kernel service so that is can be executed without any race
conditions.</p>
<p>The following pseudo code describes the logic of
AlertResumeThread:</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE</strong> AlertResumeThread (</p>
<p><strong>IN</strong> Tcb : <strong>POINTER</strong> KtThread;</p>
<p>) <strong>RETURNS</strong> integer;</p>
<p><strong>VARIABLE</strong></p>
<p>OldCount : integer;</p>
<p><strong>BEGIN</strong></p>
<p>Acquire dispatcher database lock;</p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Tcb.State == Waiting <strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Tcb.Alertable <strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p>Unwait thread with a status of Alerted;</p>
<p><strong>ELSE</strong></p>
<p>Tcb.Alerted[Kernel] = True;</p>
<p><strong>END</strong> <strong>IF</strong>;</p>
<p><strong>ELSE</strong></p>
<p>Tcb.Alerted[kernel] = True;</p>
<p><strong>END</strong> <strong>IF</strong>;</p>
<p>OldCount = Tcb.SuspendCount;</p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Tcb.SuspendCount &lt;&gt; 0
<strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p>Tcb.SuspendCount = Tcb.SuspendCount - 1;</p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Tcb.SuspendCount == 0 <strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p>Release Tcb.SuspendSemaphore;</p>
<p><strong>END IF;</strong></p>
<p><strong>END IF;</strong></p>
<p>Release dispatcher database lock;</p>
<p><strong>RETURN</strong> OldCount;</p>
<p><strong>END</strong> AlertResumeThread;</p>
<p>TestAlertThread tests the alerted flag for a specified processor mode
and returns a status value of "alerted" if the flag was set and "normal"
if the flag was clear. If the alerted flag was set, then it is cleared,
and if the specified mode is user, then an alert <strong>APC</strong> is
queued to user mode and user <strong>APC</strong> pending is set in the
calling thread's <strong>TCB</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, TestAlertThread also tests whether a user
<strong>APC</strong> should be delivered. If the specified mode is user
and the user <strong>APC</strong> queue contains an entry, then
<strong>APC</strong> pending is set in the calling thread's
<strong>TCB</strong>.</p>
<p>The following pseudo code describes the logic of TestAlert:</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE</strong> TestAlertThread (</p>
<p><strong>IN</strong> Mode : KtProcessorMode;</p>
<p>) <strong>RETURNS</strong> KtStatus;</p>
<p><strong>BEGIN</strong></p>
<p>Acquire dispatcher database lock;</p>
<p>Get current TCB address;</p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Tcb.Alerted[Mode] <strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p>Tcb.Alerted[Mode] = False;</p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Mode == User <strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p>Queue Tcb.AlertAcb;</p>
<p>Tcb.UserApcPending = True;</p>
<p><strong>END IF</strong>;</p>
<p>Release dispatcher database lock;</p>
<p><strong>RETURN</strong> Alerted;</p>
<p><strong>ELSE</strong></p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Mode == User <strong>AND</strong>
Tcb.ApcQueue[User] &lt;&gt; NIL <strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p>Tcb.UserApcPending = True;</p>
<p><strong>END IF;</strong></p>
<p>Release dispatcher database lock;</p>
<p><strong>RETURN</strong> Normal;</p>
<p><strong>END IF</strong>;</p>
<p><strong>END</strong> TestAlertThread;</p>
<p>Wait tests the alerted flags for the specified and all more
privileged processor modes if the alertable argument value is true. If
an alerted flag is set, then a status value of "alerted" is
returned.</p>
<p>In addition, Wait also tests whether a user <strong>APC</strong>
should be delivered if the alertable argument value is true and the
specified mode is user. For this case, if the user <strong>APC</strong>
queue contains an entry, then <strong>APC</strong> pending is set in the
calling thread's <strong>TCB</strong> and a status value of "UserApc" is
returned.</p>
<p>The following pseudo code describes the logic of Wait:</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE</strong> Wait (</p>
<p><strong>IN</strong> Mode : KtProcessorMode;</p>
<p><strong>IN</strong> Alertable : boolean;</p>
<p><strong>IN</strong> WaitObject : POINTER KtDispatcherObject;</p>
<p><strong>IN</strong> Timeout : POINTER integer;</p>
<p>) <strong>RETURNS</strong> KTStatus;</p>
<p><strong>BEGIN</strong></p>
<p>Repeat:</p>
<p>Acquire dispatcher database lock;</p>
<p>Get current TCB address;</p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Alertable <strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Tcb.Alerted[Mode] <strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p>Tcb.Alerted[Mode] = False;</p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Mode == User <strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p>Queue Tcb.AlertAcb;</p>
<p>Tcb.UserApcPending = True;</p>
<p><strong>END IF</strong>;</p>
<p>Release dispatcher database lock;</p>
<p><strong>RETURN</strong> Alerted;</p>
<p><strong>ELSEIF</strong> Mode == User <strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Tcb.UserApcQueue &lt;&gt; NIL
<strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p>Tcb.UserApcPending = True;</p>
<p>Release dispatcher database lock;</p>
<p><strong>RETURN</strong> UserApc;</p>
<p><strong>ELSEIF</strong> Tcb.Alerted[Kernel] <strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p>Tcb.Alerted[Kernel] = False;</p>
<p>Release dispatcher database lock;</p>
<p><strong>RETURN</strong> Alerted;</p>
<p><strong>END IF</strong>;</p>
<p><strong>END IF</strong>;</p>
<p><strong>END IF</strong>;</p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> WaitObject.Signal <strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p>Satisfy wait for WaitObject;</p>
<p>Release dispatcher database lock;</p>
<p>RETURN Tcb.WaitStatus;</p>
<p><strong>ELSE</strong></p>
<p>Tcb.Alertable = Alertable;</p>
<p>Construct wait control block for WaitObject;</p>
<p>Initialize Tcb.Timer with time out value;</p>
<p>Insert wait control block in wait queue;</p>
<p>Insert Tcb.Timer in timer queue;</p>
<p>Select new thread to run;</p>
<p>Swap context to new thread;</p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Tcb.WaitStatus == KernelApc
<strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p>Goto Repeat;</p>
<p><strong>ELSE</strong></p>
<p><strong>RETURN</strong> Tcb.WaitStatus;</p>
<p><strong>END IF</strong>;</p>
<p><strong>END IF;</strong></p>
<p><strong>END</strong> Wait;</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the executive to test for the "alerted"
return status from TestAlert and Wait and perform the correct operation
(e.g. cleaning up data structure, unwinding, etc).</p>
<p>Wait and AlertThread both allow a thread that is waiting user mode
alertable to be awakened by a kernel mode alert. If this were not done,
then it would not be possible to abort the Wait system service.</p>
<p>The interesting combinations of initial conditions and the resultant
action when a Wait system service is executed are given below.</p>
<p>Case 1</p>
<p>Wait Mode = Kernel</p>
<p>Tcb.Alerted[User] = True</p>
<p>Tcb.Alerted[Kernel] = False</p>
<p>Alertable = True</p>
<p>Action - Put thread in wait state</p>
<p>Case 2</p>
<p>Wait Mode = Kernel</p>
<p>Tcb.Alerted[User] = x</p>
<p>Tcb.Alerted[Kernel] = True</p>
<p>Alertable = True</p>
<p>Action - Clear Tcb.Alerted[Kernel] and return Alerted</p>
<p>Case</p>
<p>Wait Mode = User</p>
<p>Tcb.Alerted[User] = True</p>
<p>Tcb.Alerted[Kernel] = x</p>
<p>Alertable = True</p>
<p>Action - Clear Tcb.Alerted[User], queue Tcb.AlertAcb,</p>
<p>and set Tcb.UserApcPending</p>
<p>Case 4</p>
<p>Wait Mode = User</p>
<p>Tcb.Alerted[User] = False</p>
<p>Tcb.Alerted[Kernel] = True</p>
<p>Alertable = True</p>
<p>Action - Clear Tcb.Alerted[Kernel] and return Alerted</p>
<p>Case 5</p>
<p>Wait Mode = User</p>
<p>Tcb.Alerted[User] = False</p>
<p>Tcb.Alerted[Kernel] = False</p>
<p>Alertable = True</p>
<p>Action - Put thread in wait state</p>
<p>Kernel mode alerts can be used to implement the semantics necessary
to abort native system services. The following discussion describes how
this can be implemented in <strong>Windows NT</strong>.</p>
<p>In <strong>Mach</strong> the operations necessary to abort a native
system service are suspend, abort service, and resume. This capability
is used to get a thread out of a possible wait state in the system and
deliver a signal, terminate execution, etc.</p>
<p>A similar set of primitives can be provided in <strong>Windows
NT</strong> using the kernel alert capability.</p>
<p><strong>Windows NT</strong> suspends a thread by sending it a normal
kernel <strong>APC</strong> that causes the thread to wait on an
semaphore that is built into the thread object. The resume operation
simply releases the builtin semaphore which continues thread
execution.</p>
<p>The suspend wait operation is nonalertable to ensure that the alert
and resume operation functions properly; see below.</p>
<p>If a thread is in a wait state when it is suspended, then the wait
completion status is set to "kernel <strong>APC</strong>". This is done
so the wait can be repeated when the <strong>APC</strong> returns.</p>
<p>Implementing the primitives to abort native system services does not
quite solve the whole problem. Each native service that can result in a
long wait must be written such that it is responsive to kernel alerts.
This means that a native service should wait alertable in kernel mode
when it does a wait that could take a long time. Also, if very long
algorithms are being performed, then TestAlert should also be called at
appropriate points.</p>
<p>It is preferable that a native service either complete successfully
or be entirely aborted. For those cases where there are really two parts
to the service such as an operation followed by a wait, the service
should be broken into two parts. Each part should be executed separately
from the calling mode.</p>
<p>A protected subsystem that is a system service server can stop,
alter, and a resume a thread by performing the sequence of operations
suspend, get state, set state, and alert and resume.</p>
<p>If a native service is active when the suspend operation takes place,
then the kernel alerted flag will remain set for the duration of the
service after the thread is resumed. The alerted flag can be tested by
the service using the TestAlert function.</p>
<p>A more interesting case is when the native service is waiting kernel
mode alertable. The suspend service causes a normal kernel
<strong>APC</strong> to be sent to the target thread which completes its
wait with a status of "kernel <strong>APC</strong>". The target thread
then waits nonalertable on its builtin suspend semaphore.</p>
<p>When the subsystem executes the alert and resume service, the kernel
alerted flag is set in the target thread and the target thread's suspend
semaphore is released. This causes the target thread to be unwaited with
a status that is the key value of the semaphore.</p>
<p>Unwaiting the thread causes it to continue execution in the suspend
<strong>APC</strong> routine which simply returns to the kernel
<strong>APC</strong> delivery code. The kernel <strong>APC</strong>
delivery code restores the state of the thread and resumes execution at
the point of interruption which is in the wait code. The wait code tests
the wait completion status and determines that the wait was satisfied to
deliver a kernel <strong>APC</strong>. The wait is repeated and finds
that the kernel alerted flag is set and that the wait is alertable. Thus
it returns immediately with a wait completion status of "alerted".</p>
<p>Note that the kernel <strong>APC</strong> delivery code must save and
restore the wait completion status in the <strong>TCB</strong> so that
the subsequent suspend wait does not destroy it.</p>
