<h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>This design note describes the implementation of an NT OS/2 file
system. All NT OS/2 file systems share similar properties in their
communication with the NT OS/2 I/O system, and their basic internal flow
of control. The information presented here is based on knowledge gained
while implementing the FAT file system for NT OS/2, but also contains
information applicable to all NT OS/2 file systems.</p>
<p>Before reading this design note, the reader should be familiar with
the "NT OS/2 I/O System Specification" document and the section within
the "NT OS/2 Memory Management Design Note" regarding I/O support. The
I/O system specification presents a high level view of the NT OS/2 user
API calls and the support routines it provides for use by the various NT
OS/2 file systems and device drivers. This design augments the I/O
system document by describing in detail how a file system actually ties
into the I/O system, in terms of the I/O system's major data structures
and flow of control.</p>
<p>This design note presents a tour of the communication that occurs
between the NT OS/2 I/O system and the file system. It is intended as a
guide to file system programmers in understanding how the file system
interacts with the I/O system, and avoids discussing file system
internals, such as its internal data structures or its resource locking
mechanism and granularity.</p>
<h2 id="function-of-file-system">1.1 Function of File System</h2>
<p>The task of the file system is to handle user (and system) generated
requests to read and write files to or from a disk volume. The user
passes all I/O requests to the I/O system (via calls such as NtReadFile)
which in turn passes the request to the appropriate file system or
device driver in a structure called an I/O request packet (IRP). The IRP
contains a function code and parameters appropriate for the function.
For example, to open a file the IRP contains a code indicating an open
file operation and a file name parameter<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In the case of a file system the IRP also contains a pointer to the
device object denoting the target device that the file system should
direct all sector read and write requests towards. That is, to actually
read a sector on a device the file system calls back to the I/O system
with information from the IRP indicating which device to read.</p>
<p>In this sense, the file system is not tied to any physical device.
From the standpoint of the I/O system, a file system acts more like a
filter. In NT OS/2, disk drivers only deal with reading and writing
physical device sectors. The primary job of the file system is to add
structure to this device. So a user or system request to manipulate a
file goes from the I/O system to the file system where it is passed back
to the I/O system as actual reads and writes of sectors on a disk.</p>
<h2 id="nt-os2-environment-for-the-file-system">1.2 NT OS/2 Environment
for the File System</h2>
<p>An NT OS/2 file system exports three entry points and these entry
points are only called by the I/O system (i.e., a user never directly
calls the file system). There is an initialization routine, a dispatch
routine, and an unload routine.</p>
<p>The initialization routine is called at system start up during I/O
initialization. This routine is responsible for creating the file
system's device object and for initializing any global data structures
and processes/threads used by the file system. The structure of a file
system's device object is covered later in this design note.</p>
<p>The dispatch routine is called by the I/O system to process all IRPs
targeted for the file system. These include requests to mount a volume,
open or create a file, read and write to a file, and close a file.
Logically, the dispatch routine either completes the I/O request and
then returns control to the I/O system, or it returns to the I/O system
immediately and indicates that the I/O will be completed at a later time
(i.e., its return status is STATUS_PENDING).</p>
<p>The unload routine is called by the I/O system when the file system
is being removed from a running NT OS/2 system. The unload routine is
responsible for cleaning up all of its global data structures,
processes, and threads. After calling unload, the file system is
essentially unavailable for use until its initialization routine is
called again.</p>
<h1 id="file-system-operations">2. File System Operations</h1>
<p>This section describes the implementation details of an NT OS/2 file
system. It describes the basic flow of control through the file system
and its communication with the I/O system.</p>
<h2 id="fsdfsp-dispatch-and-communication">2.1 FSD/FSP Dispatch and
Communication</h2>
<p>The term <em>File System Driver</em> (FSD) refers to a set of
routines called by the I/O system (via the file system's dispatch
routine). These are kernel-mode routines that execute in the same
context in which they are called by the I/O system. That is, there is
not a special process/thread or context switch associated with executing
the FSD. Execution paths through the FSD should be fairly short and not
require long waits (e.g., for a disk I/O to complete).</p>
<p>The workhorse of the file system is the <em>File System Process</em>
(FSP). The term FSP refers to the set of threads executing within a
dedicated file system process. Unlike the FSD, the FSP has the entire
user address space available for use, and can dedicate threads to
systematically attend to the tasks associated with an I/O request. An
FSP thread can wait for I/O to complete and can easily maintain context
unavailable to the FSD.</p>
<p>Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between the FSD and the FSP.
The FSD is called by the I/O system with an IRP containing the requested
operation. Then, based on the amount of work and context required by the
request, the FSD either sends the necessary read and write requests to
the target device object (as associated IRPs) or it enqueues the IRP to
the work queue used by the FSP. If the request is queued to the FSP, the
FSP dequeues the IRP and performs the work required to complete the
request.</p>
<p>Figure 1 - FSD/FSP Layout</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, file read and write requests can usually go
through the FSD directly to the target device object. All other
requests, such as file create, that require file system buffering or
data structure editing go through the FSP.</p>
<p>Within a single file system, there are multiple work queues and an
FSP thread dedicated to each queue. The FSP thread is a normal thread
(i.e., it is merely the name of a thread that is handling work queue
activity). There is a queue to handle mount requests and a queue for
each mounted volume. The construction and use of each work queue is
described in the following subsections.</p>
<h2 id="file-system-initialization">2.2 File System Initialization</h2>
<p>The file system initialization procedure is called at system start up
during I/O initialization. This procedure is responsible for creating
the device object for the file system, creating the FSP process, and
starting the FSP mount thread. It also initializes all of the global
data structures used by the file system. It is called with a pointer to
the driver object for the file system created by the I/O system.</p>
<p>The device object created at initialization is called the <em>file
system device object</em> and contains the name of the file system
(e.g., "\Fat") and a work queue. All mount requests are sent by the FSD
dispatcher to this work queue and are processed by a dedicated FSP mount
thread. Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between the file system
device object and the FSP mount thread.</p>
<p>Figure 2 - File System Initialization</p>
<p>In summary, the initialization phase creates a file system device
object and sets a pointer to it in the Driver Object. It also creates
the FSP process and FSP mount thread. The FSP mount thread only
processes requests that are placed in the file system device object's
work queue, and the only type of requests valid in that work queue are
mount volume requests.</p>
<h2 id="before-the-first-operation-on-a-volume">2.3 Before the First
Operation on a Volume</h2>
<p>When a user calls NtCreateFile, one of the first things the I/O
system must decide is whether the volume targeted by the request is
mounted. If this is the first operation on the volume, then the volume
is not mounted and the I/O system must send an IRP to the file system
requesting that the volume be mounted. After the volume is mounted, the
I/O system can then forward the create file request.</p>
<p>On a mount request, the I/O system calls the file system FSD dispatch
routine passing as input parameters a pointer to the file system device
object and an IRP (See Figure 3a). The IRP contains two parameters of
interest<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. There is a pointer to a volume
parameter block (VPB) and to a targeted device object. The VPB is a
structure used to denote a disk volume. It will contain, after the
volume is mounted, the volume label and its serial number. Within the
system, there is one VPB for every mounted volume.</p>
<p>The targeted device object is the device object that is to be used by
the file system when it issues a read or write sector request. The VPB
also contains a pointer to a device object (this field is set by the I/O
system) called the real device (not shown in Figure 3). In most cases,
the targeted device object and real device are identical and simply
denote the disk driver containing the volume (e.g., a floppy or hard
disk). However, to accommodate multi-volume disk sets and disk
strippers, the targeted device object and the real device can be
different device objects. The file system only sends request to the
targeted device object and never to the real device.</p>
<p>Figure 3a shows the parameters and data structures sent to the file
system FSD dispatch routine on a mount request. When it is called, the
FSD dispatcher will enqueue the mount request to the FSP mount thread's
work queue. Note that the work queue is located by the FSD dispatcher
via the file system device object which is passed in as an input
parameter.</p>
<p>Figure 3 - Processing a Mount Request</p>
<p>To process the mount request, the FSP mount thread issues the
necessary read sector requests to the targeted device object to decide
if the volume belongs to this file system (e.g., whether it is a Fat
file system or a Pinball file system). If the mount is successful, the
file system creates a new device object for the volume. This device
object replaces the device object originally referenced by the VPB. It
contains a work queue for the volume, and a volume control block (VCB).
Upon completion of a successful mount operation, the file system also
inserts in the VPB the volume label and serial number. Figure 3b shows
the results after a successful mount request.</p>
<p>The FSP mount thread also creates a new FSP volume thread to process
subsequent I/O requests targeted for the volume. That is, when the I/O
system calls the FSD dispatcher to do I/O to a mounted volume, it will
pass as input a pointer to the volume device object and not the file
system device object. The FSD dispatcher will then send the request to
the work queue for the appropriate FSP volume thread.</p>
<p>A slightly different chain of events takes place if the volume being
mounted has previously been mounted by the file system. That is, the
file system already possesses a VCB for the volume. This situation can
occur with removable media where the I/O system is attempting an
operation on what it thinks is a new volume, when in reality the volume
was mounted in a different drive at an earlier time.</p>
<p>To handle the remount case, the file system will keep track of every
device object that is mounted and search this list whenever a new mount
request is processed. If a match with a previous volume is found, the
file system will then simply replace the new VPB it is given as input
with the old VPB. This simply requires changing the real device pointer
found in the VPB and the target device object pointer found in the old
VCB. The remount process is illustrated in Figure 4.</p>
<p>Figure 4 - Volume Remount</p>
<p>In summary, the file system's mount procedure is used to establish
that the target device object contains a proper file system structure.
If the file system recognizes the on disk structure, it creates a new
device object for the volume in place of the file system device object,
sets the volume label and serial number in the VPB, and starts up an FSP
volume thread.</p>
<h2 id="open-and-create-file-operations">2.4 Open and Create File
Operations</h2>
<p>The open and create file<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> operation takes as input
a file object denoting the file being opened and the device object
(created by the file system) which is targeted for the operation. The
FSD dispatcher queues the open and create file requests to the work
queue for the appropriate FSP volume thread. Figure 5a illustrates the
input given to the FSD dispatcher.</p>
<p>Figure 5 - Opening and Creating a File</p>
<p>The file object passed to the file system contains the file name
being opened relative to the root of the volume and it contains the
requested access mode. It is the job of the file system to open the file
on the targeted device object. The information available to the file
system is the device object of the volume (passed as input from the I/O
system), the VCB and VPB associated with the volume, and a pointer to
the targeted device object. The FSP volume thread is free to issue as
many read and write sector commands to the targeted device object as
necessary to open (create) the file.</p>
<p>When the file is successfully opened, the file system creates a file
control block (FCB)<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> and a context control block (CCB)
which are both used to store information about the opened file. Both of
these records are referenced by the file object through its two
FsContext pointers. The file object also contains a section object
pointer which points to a reserved longword in the FCB. This longword is
used by the memory management system. See Figure 5b.</p>
<p>The FCB and CCB are internal file system control structures. An FCB
is created for every opened file on a volume. It contains the file name,
mapping information, and a pointer to the VCB containing the file<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Only one FCB is created per opened
file. The FCB is shared by multiple file objects if the file objects
denote the same file. A CCB is created for every file object<a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> and contains information specific to
the file object, such as current file position information.</p>
<p>In summary, when opening a file, the file system is passed as input a
file object denoting the file and a device object denoting the volume
where the file is to exist. If the open operation is successful, the
file system creates an FCB and a CCB record, both referenced by the file
object.</p>
<h2 id="read-write-set-and-query-file-operations">2.5 Read, Write, Set,
and Query File Operations</h2>
<p>The basic operations on a file, after it is opened, are read, write,
set, and query. These operations take as input a file object and a
pointer to the device object for the volume. See Figure 6.</p>
<p>Figure 6 - Read, Write, Set, and Query File Input</p>
<p>When processing an IRP of this type, the FSD dispatcher can either
send the IRP to the FSP work queue and let the FSP volume thread handle
the request, or it can complete the request itself. The FSP can actually
handle all types I/O requests; however, for efficiency, it is better to
have the FSD handle the requests when possible. The criterion used to
determine if the FSD can handle a request are the amount of time
required to process the request and the type of resource locks needed to
read or alter the file system's internal data structures. If a lot of
extra processing is required or if too many time consuming locks are
needed to perform the operation, then the FSP should handle the
request.</p>
<p>These operations do not alter the infrastructure connecting the file
object, device object, FCB, or CCB. However, they still may need to
acquire an exclusive resource lock on the structures in order to alter
their other fields (such as setting a delete flag or expanding file
allocation).</p>
<h2 id="close-file-operation">2.6 Close File Operation</h2>
<p>The last operation on a file is the close operation. This operation
takes the same input as the preceding read, write, set, and query
operations, but unlike those operations, the close operation modifies
the infrastructure.</p>
<p>To do a close operation, the file system first performs any necessary
I/O to the target device object to either close or delete the file. It
then removes the FCB<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> and CCB from its internal data
structure. After the close operation the file object is no longer valid
and must be removed (or recycled) by the I/O system.</p>
