<p><strong>NT OS/2 Suspend/Resume Design Note</strong></p>

<p>This design note discusses a proposal to implement suspend and resume
as part of the kernel rather than in the executive layer.</p>
<p>The suspension of a thread is controlled by a suspend count and a
semaphore object that is built into the thread object. This semaphore
has an initial value of zero and a maximum count of two (see explanation
at end of this document as to why the maximum count must be two rather
than one).</p>
<p>When an attempt is made to suspend a thread, the suspend count is
incremented and a check is made to determine if the thread is already
suspended (indicated by a nonzero initial suspend count). If the thread
is not suspended, then a normal kernel <strong>APC</strong> is queued to
the thread which will cause it to wait on its builtin semaphore.</p>
<p>A special case arises when the builtin <strong>APC</strong> is
already queued to the target thread. This situation occurs when the
target thread has been suspended and then resumed, but has never
actually received the <strong>APC</strong> and suspended itself. Since
the target thread has never actually suspended itself, the builtin
semaphore count is decremented to indicate that the thread should
suspend rather than resume.</p>
<p>The following pseudo code describes the logic of SuspendThread;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE</strong> SuspendThread (</p>
<p><strong>IN</strong> Tcb : <strong>POINTER</strong> KtThread;</p>
<p>) <strong>RETURNS</strong> integer;</p>
<p><strong>VARIABLE</strong></p>
<p>OldCount : integer;</p>
<p><strong>BEGIN</strong></p>
<p>Acquire dispatcher database lock;</p>
<p>OldCount = Tcb.SuspendCount;</p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Tcb.SuspendCount == 0 <strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> <strong>NOT</strong> QueueApc(Tcb.SuspendAcb)
<strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p>Tcb.SuspendSemaphore.Signal =</p>
<p>Tcb.SuspendSemaphore.Signal - 1;</p>
<p><strong>END IF;</strong></p>
<p><strong>END IF;</strong></p>
<p>Tcb.SuspendCount = Tcb.SuspendCount + 1;</p>
<p>Release dispatcher database lock;</p>
<p><strong>RETURN</strong> OldCount;</p>
<p><strong>END</strong> SuspendThread;</p>
<p>Resuming a thread checks to determine if the thread has been
suspended by examining the suspend count. If the thread has not been
suspended, then no operation is performed. Otherwise the suspend count
is decremented. If the resultant value is zero, then the target thread's
builtin suspend semaphore is released.</p>
<p>The following pseudo code describes the logic of ResumeThread;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE</strong> ResumeThread (</p>
<p><strong>IN</strong> Tcb : <strong>POINTER</strong> KtThread;</p>
<p>) <strong>RETURNS</strong> integer;</p>
<p><strong>VARIABLE</strong></p>
<p>OldCount : integer;</p>
<p><strong>BEGIN</strong></p>
<p>Acquire dispatcher database lock;</p>
<p>OldCount = Tcb.SuspendCount;</p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Tcb.SuspendCount &lt;&gt; 0
<strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p>Tcb.SuspendCount = Tcb.SuspendCount - 1;</p>
<p>IF Tcb.SuspendCount == 0 THEN</p>
<p>Release Tcb.SuspendSemaphore;</p>
<p><strong>END IF</strong>;</p>
<p><strong>END</strong> <strong>IF</strong>;</p>
<p>Release dispatcher database lock;</p>
<p><strong>RETURN</strong> OldCount;</p>
<p><strong>END</strong> SuspendThread;</p>
<p>The maximum count of the builtin semaphore must be two so that the
following race condition can be avoided.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. a target thread is suspended by incrementing its suspend count to
one and queuing its builtin suspend <strong>APC</strong></p>
<p>2. before the thread can respond to the suspend <strong>APC</strong>,
it is resumed which causes the suspend count to be decremented to zero
and the builtin suspend semaphore to be incremented to one</p>
<p>3. the thread receives the suspend <strong>APC</strong>, but before
it can wait on the builtin semaphore it is interrupted to deliver a
special kernel <strong>APC</strong></p>
<p>4. the special kernel <strong>APC</strong> code page faults and waits
on the page to be brought into memory</p>
<p>5. the target thread is again suspended which causes its suspend
count to be incremented and its builtin suspend <strong>APC</strong> to
be queued</p>
<p>6. the thread is resumed before it has finished processing the
special kernel <strong>APC</strong> which causes the suspend count to be
decremented to zero and the builtin semaphore to be incremented to
two</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No additional nesting can occur since further attempts to queue the
<strong>APC</strong> will fail which cause the semaphore count to be
decremented. Thus the maximum count does not need to be greater than
two.</p>
