<p><strong>Windows NT APC Design Note</strong></p>
<p><strong>Author</strong>: <em>David N. Cutler</em></p>

<p><em>Revision 1.2, March 30, 1989</em></p>
<p>The following design note describes a proposal for the handling of
<strong>APC</strong>'s in <strong>Windows NT</strong>. The companion
design notes on alerts and attach process contain information and
algorithms that are pertinent to this design.</p>
<p>The nice thing about <strong>APC</strong>'s is that they interrupt
thread execution at any point and cause a procedure to be executed in
the context of a specified thread. This capability can be used to reduce
the number of threads required to perform a particular function and can
alleviate the need for polling.</p>
<p>The new model for implementing <strong>OS/2</strong> and
<strong>POSIX</strong> compatibility with protected subsystems would
suggest that <strong>APC</strong>'s could be used to substantially
reduce the overhead and implementation complexity of these subsystems.
For instance <strong>OS/2</strong> timers could be implemented by
<strong>NT</strong> timers that queue an <strong>APC</strong> when they
expire. The <strong>APC</strong> would be fielded by the
<strong>OS/2</strong> subsystem which would clear the appropriate
semaphore and delete or repeat the timer as appropriate.</p>
<p>As good as this all sounds it is not without flaw. The very thing
that makes <strong>APC</strong>'s so useful is also the same thing that
makes them so bad. This is the fact that they interrupt a thread at
arbitrary points. To get past this liability, the capability to
"disable" <strong>APC</strong>'s over short regions of code is needed.
But this then has the problem of not being very modular and also
requires a lot of thought on the part of the user. Writing code that is
"<strong>APC</strong>" safe is VERY difficult.</p>
<p><strong>SRC</strong> never recognized the need for
<strong>APC</strong>'s but did recognize that it was useful to be able
to send a thread an alert signal. This signal typically means quit what
you are doing and reset to some canonical state. <strong>SRC's</strong>
system provides a function to send an alert to a thread
(<em>AlertThread</em>), a function to test if a thread had been alerted
(<em>TestAlert</em>), and a form of wait that allows a thread to be
alerted while it is waiting (<em>WaitAlertable</em>).</p>
<p>When TestAlert or WaitAlertable is called and the subject thread has
been alerted, then the condition "alert" is raised. In addition, if
AlertThread is called while a thread is waiting as the result of a call
to WaitAlertable, then the thread is unwaited and the "alert" condition
is raised.</p>
<p>The nice thing about the <strong>SRC</strong> alert design is that
the alert condition occurs at well defined points in the execution of a
program. These points are exactly the points where the program says it
is alertable. Writing code that is "alert" safe is easy.</p>
<p>We do not want to drop the flexibility of <strong>APC</strong>'s, but
at the same time we do not want to interrupt the execution of a thread
at arbitrary points. Therefore why not combine the notion of alertable
with the functionality of <strong>APC</strong>'s? To do this we simply
do not deliver an <strong>APC</strong> unless the thread is alertable or
calls TestAlert.</p>
<p>We only need to do this for user mode, and it fact, do not want to do
this for kernel mode as we need to break into the kernel mode execution
of a thread at an arbitrary point. As system designers this does not (or
more succinctly better not!) present us with the same level of
difficulty that it does the run of the mill user.</p>
<p>Thus in user mode, <strong>APC</strong>'s are only delivered at
points where the program is alertable. In kernel mode
<strong>APC</strong>'s are delivered when the appropriate enabling
conditions are present.</p>
<p>The following is an explantion of how <strong>APC</strong>'s would
work using the concepts described above.</p>
<p>There are three types of <strong>APC</strong>'s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. special kernel</p>
<p>2. normal kernel</p>
<p>3. normal user</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A special kernel <strong>APC</strong> is deliverable whenever the
Interrupt Request Level (<strong>IRQL</strong>) of the corresponding
thread is equal to zero, and executes in kernel mode at
<strong>IRQL</strong> 1. This type of <strong>APC</strong> is used to
break into a thread's execution and perform some short operation such as
posting <strong>I/O</strong> status. Code that runs as the result of a
special kernel <strong>APC</strong> is not allowed to acquire any
mutexes that can also be acquired at <strong>IRQL</strong> 0. Special
kernel <strong>APC</strong> code is allowed to take page faults, and
thus memory management code must ensure that it runs at
<strong>IRQL</strong> 1 when it owns a mutex that could also be acquired
during a special kernel <strong>APC</strong>.</p>
<p>A normal kernel <strong>APC</strong> is deliverable whenever the
<strong>IRQL</strong> of the corresponding thread is equal to zero, a
normal kernel <strong>APC</strong> is not already in progress, and the
thread does not own any kernel level mutexes. Normal kernel
<strong>APC</strong> code executes at <strong>IRQL</strong> 0 and is
allowed to execute any code including all system services.</p>
<p>A normal user <strong>APC</strong> is deliverable at any time the
target thread is user mode alertable. Normal user <strong>APC</strong>
code executes at <strong>IRQL</strong> 0 and is allowed to execute any
code including all system services.</p>
<p>Both normal kernel and normal user <strong>APC's</strong> can also
specify a routine that is to be executed in kernel mode at
<strong>IRQL</strong> 1 just prior to executing the normal
<strong>APC</strong> routine.</p>
<p>Each thread has a machine state which includes <strong>IRQL</strong>,
an <strong>APC</strong> pending flag for each of the modes kernel and
user, an <strong>APC</strong> in progress flag for kernel mode, and the
number of mutexes that are owned in kernel mode. This state is used to
determine when an <strong>APC</strong> should be delivered to a
thread.</p>
<p>Unlike <strong>VAX</strong> or <strong>PRISM</strong>, there is no
hardware support for <strong>APC</strong>'s. Thus at each exit from
kernel mode (i.e. on each <strong>REI</strong> type of operation),
appropriate tests must be made to determine whether an
<strong>APC</strong> should be delivered or not.</p>
<p>The following pseudo code describes the logic of system exit:</p>
<p>ExitFromSystem:</p>
<p>disable interrupts;</p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Previous IRQL == 0 <strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p>Get current TCB address;</p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Previous mode == Kernel <strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Tcb.KernelApcPending <strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p>IRQL = 1;</p>
<p>Call kernel APC delivery code;</p>
<p><strong>END IF</strong>;</p>
<p><strong>ELSEIF</strong> Tcb.UserApcPending <strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p>IRQL = 1;</p>
<p>Call user APC delivery code;</p>
<p><strong>END IF</strong>;</p>
<p><strong>END IF</strong>;</p>
<p>Restore state and continue execution;</p>
<p>The user <strong>APC</strong> delivery code is only called when an
<strong>APC</strong> can actually be delivered to user mode. Calling the
kernel <strong>APC</strong> delivery code, however, does not guarantee
that a kernel <strong>APC</strong> can really be delivered. Further
checks must be performed to ensure that proper enabling conditions are
present. These tests include whether the thread currently owns any
mutexes and whether a normal kernel <strong>APC</strong> is already in
progress.</p>
<p>A thread in <strong>Windows NT</strong> can be in one of six
states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. initialized - the thread has been initialized but has not been
readied for execution.</p>
<p>2. running - the thread is currently in execution on some
processor.</p>
<p>3. ready - the thread is either in a processor ready queue (i.e.
ready to execute) or in a process ready queue (i.e. process is not in
balance set).</p>
<p>4. standby - the thread has been selected to run on a processor but
has not actually started its execution.</p>
<p>5. terminated - the thread has terminated but has not yet been
rundown (e.g. all resources have not been returned).</p>
<p>6. waiting - the thread is waiting on one or more dispatcher objects
to attain a state of signaled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When an <strong>APC</strong> is queued, certain tests must be
performed to determine what action if any should be taken.<br />
The following pseudo code describes the logic of queuing an
<strong>APC</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE</strong> QueueApc (</p>
<p><strong>IN</strong> Acb : <strong>POINTER</strong> KtApc;</p>
<p><strong>IN</strong> Tcb : <strong>POINTER</strong> KtThread;</p>
<p>);</p>
<p><strong>BEGIN</strong></p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Acb.Mode == Kernel <strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Acb.Type == Special <strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p>Insert APC at front of thread kernel APC</p>
<p>queue selected by Acb.ApcIndex;</p>
<p><strong>ELSE</strong></p>
<p>Insert APC at end of thread kernel APC queue</p>
<p>selected by Acb.ApcIndex;</p>
<p><strong>END IF</strong>;</p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Tcb.State == Running <strong>AND</strong></p>
<p>Acb.ApcIndex == Tcb.ApcIndex <strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Tcb.NextProcessor == CurrentProcessor
<strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p>Set software interrupt at IRQL 1;</p>
<p><strong>ELSE</strong></p>
<p>Set APC delivery request for target</p>
<p>processor;</p>
<p>Set interrupt request for target</p>
<p>processor;</p>
<p><strong>END IF</strong>;</p>
<p><strong>ELSEIF</strong> (Tcb.State == Waiting
<strong>AND</strong></p>
<p>Acb.ApcIndex == Tcb.ApcIndex <strong>AND</strong></p>
<p>Tcb.WaitIrql == 0) <strong>AND</strong></p>
<p>(Acb.Type == Special <strong>OR</strong></p>
<p>(Tcb.MutexCount == 0 <strong>AND</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOT</strong> Tcb.KernelApcInProgress))
<strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p>Unwait thread with status of KernelApc;</p>
<p><strong>END IF;</strong></p>
<p>Tcb.KernelApcPending = True;</p>
<p><strong>ELSE</strong></p>
<p>Insert APC at the end of thread user APC queue</p>
<p>selected by Acb.ApcIndex;</p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> Tcb.State == Waiting <strong>AND</strong></p>
<p>Acb.ApcIndex == Tcb.ApcIndex <strong>AND</strong></p>
<p>Tcb.WaitMode == User <strong>AND</strong></p>
<p>Tcb.Alertable <strong>THEN</strong></p>
<p>Tcb.UserApcPending = True;</p>
<p>Unwait thread with status of Alerted;</p>
<p><strong>END IF</strong>;</p>
<p><strong>END IF</strong>;</p>
<p><strong>END</strong> QueueApc;</p>
<p>A thread may be unwaited to execute a special kernel, normal kernel,
or normal user <strong>APC</strong>.</p>
<p>If the <strong>APC</strong> executes in kernel mode then the
<strong>APC</strong> will have already been executed by the time that
execution continues in the wait code. For this case the wait function is
merely repeated.</p>
<p>If the <strong>APC</strong> executes in user mode, then execution
continues in the wait code without having deliverd the user
<strong>APC</strong>. For this case, the wait code simply returns the
status "alerted" to the executive level Wait routine. The executive
level Wait routine must return a status of "RepeatService" to the system
service dispatch. The system service dispatcher backs up the
<strong>PC</strong> so that the wait service will be repeated, restores
state as necessary, and then executes the "<strong>REI</strong>" which
will cause a user <strong>APC</strong> to occur.</p>
