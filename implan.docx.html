<h1 id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p><strong>NT OS/2</strong> , here referred to simply as
<strong>NT</strong>, is a new operating system product being developed
by <strong>Microsoft</strong> which is portable and supports the Windows
32-bit base system APIs, graphical user interface, and window management
software.</p>
<p>This document describes implementation plans for the
<strong>NT</strong> operating system and contains product descriptions,
projected release dates, an overall schedule, a summary of the work
items to be performed, and a list of external dependencies.</p>
<p>Development on <strong>NT</strong> actually began approximately two
years ago and has progressed to the point where significant system
functionality is operational on both 386/486 and MIPS RISC
platforms.</p>
<p>In addition to the development of the <strong>NT</strong> operating
system, <strong>Microsoft</strong> is also developing a reference
implementation for RISC PCs based on the MIPS R4000 microprocessor chip.
This hardware architecture will be the main target for the first
<strong>NT</strong> product release.</p>
<p>The development and product releases of <strong>NT</strong> will be
phased such that new markets are addressed first, followed by high end
server markets, and finally the general workstation market.</p>
<p><strong>NT</strong> is aimed at the high end of
<strong>Microsoft's</strong> systems business and, when running on an
386/486 platform, will share a binary compatible 32-bit programming
interface with the low end implementation of the Windows 32-bit
operating system environment based on DOS and an extension of Windows
3.0.</p>
<p>On RISC systems, <strong>NT</strong> will provide source level
compatiblity with the 386/486 versions of the Windows 32-bit operating
system environment, and binary compatibility with other RISC systems of
the same architecture.</p>
<p>Typically <strong>NT</strong> will service markets requiring larger
memories and higher performance (e.g., greater than 4mb and RISC
performance levels), whereas the low end system will service markets
requiring smaller memories, lower performance, and x86 binary
compatibility (.e.g, less than 4mb of memory and up to 486
performance).</p>
<p>Currently four major product releases are planned, although it is
likely that one of more of these releases will be combined.</p>
<p>The first release of <strong>NT</strong> is planned as a workstation
product that will provide a strong competitor to UN*X based
workstations. It will provide the Windows 32-bit operating system
environment, a POSIX compliant execution environment, high integrity,
robustnesss, security, and be network enabled as both a client and a
server. The primary target for this release is a MIPS based RISC PC,
although a 386/486 system will also be developed in parallel and be
ready for deployment.</p>
<p>\A major issue that needs to get resolved is whether DOS and/or
Windows 16-bit emulation needs to be provided on the RISC platform.
Another issue relates to whether the 1003.2 tools need to be delivered
with the POSIX environment./</p>
<p>The second release of <strong>NT</strong> is planned as a scalable
performance server product and adds multiprocessor support for 486
systems, LanMan 3.0 functionality, an extensive set of network device
drivers, and the full services needed to replace OS/2 1.x as the primary
<strong>Microsoft</strong> server platform. Its main marketing goal is
to provide strong competitor with Novell for server based systems.</p>
<p>The third release of <strong>NT</strong> adds full support for
386/486 workstations and includes DOS emulation, Windows 16-bit
emulation, OS/2 32-bit Base APIs, and certified C2 security. It will
provide a full PC workstation environment.</p>
<p>The fourth release of <strong>NT</strong> adds support for
multiprocessor RISC servers. This release will most lilely be combined
with the second release if hardware is available for testing and
evaluation.</p>
<p>In addition to the planned product releases, an OAK, DDK, SDK, and
source porting kit will be available at the appropriate times.</p>
<h1 id="overall-goals">2. Overall Goals</h1>
<p>The overall long term goals for the <strong>NT</strong> project are
to:</p>
<p>o Provide <strong>Microsoft</strong> with a high end Windows 32-bit
operating system that is portable, secure, and provides the base
technology to compete with UN*X on the desktop, Novell in the network,
and provides the advanced features necessary to implement "information
at your finger tips".</p>
<p>o Provide <strong>Microsoft</strong> with a reference implementation
of a RISC platform based on the MIPS R4000 microporcessor chip that can
be used to facilitate the establishment of standards for the
implementation of RISC PCs and servers.</p>
<p>o Deliver on the above two goals by providing a series of product
releases that build functionality, let <strong>Microsoft</strong>
address new markets, and provide strong compatibility ties to existing
and future low end products.</p>
<p>The specific development goals for <strong>NT</strong> are:</p>
<p>o Portability - <strong>NT</strong> will be written in C and will be
portable to RISC, the 386/486, and other architectures. A typical port
to a new architecture should take no longer than six calender
months.</p>
<p>o Security - <strong>NT</strong> will be designed to have pervasive
security and will be capable of attaining the "B" levels of security as
defined by the U.S. government. Initially it will be certified at the C2
level.</p>
<p>o Compatibility - <strong>NT</strong> will provide a high degree of
compatiblity with other <strong>Microsoft</strong> systems.</p>
<p>- Window 32-bit Environment - Binary compatibility with the low end
implementation of 32-bit Windows environment will be provided when
running on a 386/486 system. On RISC platforms, source level
compatibility with 386/486 systems will be provided and binary
compatibiity with other RISC platforms of the same architecture.</p>
<p>- OS/2 32-bit Base APIs - Binary compatibility will be provided with
the OS/2 2.0 32-bit Base APIs when running on a 386/486 platform. On
RISC platforms source level compatiblity will be provided.</p>
<p>\OS/2 32-bit Base API binary compatibility is predicated on IBM
accepting and implementing all of the NT OS/2 DCRs that were implemented
in Cruiser. This includes the image format, structured exception
handling, alignment of arguments, and changes to the semantics of
muxwait.\</p>
<p>- DOS and Windows 16-bit Environment - Binary compatibility with DOS
and 16-bit Windows will be provided when running on a 386/486 system. On
RISC platforms, these capabilities will be provided via software
emulation of the 8086 instruction set.</p>
<p>\It is not clear how extensive these capabilites will be. The
simplest and most straight forward approach is to only run "clean" APPs
that do not make arcane use of hardware resources. If all APPS have to
be executed without change, then this goal becomes more difficult to
achieve. Another question is whether network services need to be
available to 16-bit environments.\</p>
<p>- File Systems - Binary compatible on-disk structures will be
provided for the FAT, HPFS, and CD-ROM file systems on both 386/486 and
RISC platforms.</p>
<p>- Network - LanMan compatible protocols, redirector, server, and
network services will be provided.</p>
<p>o Multiprocessors - <strong>NT</strong> will support symmetric
multiprocessing and provide scalable performance on 486 and RISC based
platforms.</p>
<p>o POSIX - <strong>NT</strong> will provide a POSIX compliant IEEE
1003.1 (FIPS 151-1) POSIX execution environment for deployment in the
government marketplace.</p>
<p>o Virtual Memory - <strong>NT</strong> will provide support for a
32-bit flat addressed virtual environment with demand paging, mapped
files, and asynchronous I/O.</p>
<p>The 486 and RISC PC platforms will be fully supported by
<strong>NT</strong> and will provide a robust and high integrity system.
The deficiencies in the 386 memory management architecture, however,
will not be fully masked and will result in a 386 based system that is
less secure and does not exhibit the same level of integrity and
robustness as the 486 and RISC systems. In actual practice this should
not be a concern and only represents an exposure in a system under
malicious attack.</p>
<p>\386 platforms must contain an i386 B6 stepping or above to be
supported. Earlier steppings will not be supported and an attempt to
boot on such a platform will be rejected by the NT system with an
appropriate error message.\</p>
<h1
id="major-milestones-implementation-strategy-and-overall-schedule">3.
Major Milestones, Implementation Strategy, and Overall Schedule</h1>
<p>Several major milestones are planned on the road to a the first
release of an <strong>NT</strong> product. These milestones lead through
a progression of functionality and will increase confidence that the
implementation is proceeding according to plan.</p>
<p>Currently <strong>NT</strong> boots and executes user programs on
both 386/486 and MIPS R3000 based DECstation 5000s. However, the network
software is not complete, the complete set of development tools are not
in place, the implementation of the Windows 32-bit base system APIs,
graphical user interface, and window management environment are just
beginning, and the system is not capable of supporting its own
development. In addition, the Jazz hardware is not yet available for
software development.</p>
<p>The first major milestone is the finalization of the implemenation
plan, product descriptions, and development schedule. This is expected
to occur before the end of the year with the first draft completed by
<strong>November 30, 1990</strong>.</p>
<p>The main implementation strategy for <strong>NT</strong> is to
provide a self hosted development environment on <strong>NT</strong> as
quickly as possible. This will provide more testing, force the focus to
a stable system that supports its own development, and provide a viable
system for ISV and hardware OEM development.</p>
<p>Self hosting will first occur on the 386/486 and be followed shortly
thereafter on the Jazz MIPS hardware. The initial self hosted
development environment will support network connections to the source
code server, character mode development tools, and will require an
additional machine for mail and producing word documents.</p>
<p>The target date for self hosting on 386/486 systems is <strong>March
26, 1991</strong> and the target date for the Jazz MIPS system is
<strong>April 25, 1991</strong>.</p>
<p>Self hosting with character mode tools will be followed by a windows
environment that supports an ANSI terminal window. This will allow the
windowing and graphical user interface software to be combined into the
system that is running on each developer's desktop.</p>
<p>The target date for a self hosted system on both the 386/486 and Jazz
MIPS platforms using the windowing environment is
<strong>????</strong>.</p>
<p>The next major milestone is a Beta Test SDK that contains a full
Windows 32-bit environment on both 386/486 and Jazz platforms. The
target date for the Beta Test SDK is <strong>????</strong>.</p>
<p>It is envisioned that two major updates to the beta-test SDK will be
required before the first real product release. These updates will occur
at approximately 3 month intervals.</p>
<p>The target for the first product release is
<strong>????</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="self-hosted-development-environment">4. Self Hosted Development
Environment</h1>
<p>The self hosted development system provides for the development of
<strong>NT</strong> on <strong>NT</strong>. There are three self hosted
system milestones described below.</p>
<h2 id="ansi-terminal-based-386486-self-hosted-system">4.1. ANSI
Terminal Based 386/486 Self Hosted System</h2>
<p>The 386/486 self hosted system will occur first and will contain
following tools and components:</p>
<p>1. A completely functional <strong>NT</strong> base system with
virtual memory, multithreading, process management, image/DLL loader,
file system support (FAT and HPFS), and disk driver (ST506).</p>
<p>2. Support for the Windows 32-bit base system API minus the named
pipe, sound, and registration APIs.</p>
<p>3. ANSI terminal support for character mode APPs in the keyboard,
mouse, and display drivers.</p>
<p>4. A complete C runtime library that uses the Windows 32-bit base
system APIs.</p>
<p>5. A command interpreter (CMD.EXE) and the Z-Tools.</p>
<p>6. The source language maintenance utility (SLM).</p>
<p>7. A full screen editor (MEP).</p>
<p>8. The make utility (NMAKE).</p>
<p>9. A native profile utility.</p>
<p>10. A linker that produces executable images and DLLs.</p>
<p>11. An object module conversion utility to convert from the
<strong>Microsoft</strong> x86 object format to the COFF
format(CVTOMF).</p>
<p>12. The <strong>NT</strong> system build utility (BUILD.EXE).</p>
<p>13. A LanMan redirector that is capable of communicating with and
accessing files and printing on a LanMan 2.0 server.</p>
<p>14. A NetBeui transport.</p>
<p>15. The CFRONT C++ preprocessor.</p>
<p>16. An Etherlink II NDIS driver.</p>
<p>17. A 386/486 C compiler with structured exception handling.</p>
<p>18. A 386/486 assembler.</p>
<p>19. A 386/486 user mode debugger.</p>
<p>20. An OS/2 hosted 386/486 kernel debugger.</p>
<p>The <strong>NT</strong> group will deliver all of these components
except the last four items which will be delivered by the
<strong>Microsoft</strong> Languages group.</p>
<p>\A schedule commmitment is required from the languages group for
support of an NT OS/2 hosted 386/486 C compiler, 386/486 assembler, and
386/486 user mode debugger.\</p>
<p>Four people from the <strong>NT</strong> group will be responsible
for pulling together the actual system and verifying its operation over
a 6-8 week period. These people are tentatively identified as Bryanwi,
Stever, Garyki, and Davidtr. Kylesh from the testing group will be the
offical build resource and will be responsible for maintaining the build
and maintenance trees.</p>
<p>People developing the MIPS self hosted system will not be able to
switch their development environment to the 386/486 <strong>NT</strong>
system since they will have to be able to continue to compile on the
DECstation 5000 systems which are accessed using TCP/IP.</p>
<p>The target data for the self hosted 386/486 system is <strong>March
26, 1991</strong>.</p>
<p>\A complete set of Windows 32-bit base system API tests should be
operatioinal to check out this system. What other tests should be
available?\</p>
<p>\A complete set of network aware file tests should be available.\</p>
<p>\File system and file server stress tests should be available.\</p>
<p>\Are there any doucmentation requirements?\</p>
<p>Documentation will be required for installation and a description of
the features that are, and are not, available in the various
utilities.</p>
<h2 id="ansi-terminal-based-mips-self-hosted-system">4.2. ANSI Terminal
Based MIPS Self Hosted System</h2>
<p>The MIPS self hosted system implementation will proceed in parallel
with the 386/486 self hosted system support but will not occur until
after the 386/486 version. It will contain the following additional
tools and components:</p>
<p>1. A port of the <strong>NT</strong> base system from the DECstation
5000 to the R3000 based Jazz system. This requires a new set of device
drivers for the SCSI and floopy disks and an update to the original i860
bootstrap code.</p>
<p>2. A port of the <strong>NT</strong> base system from the R3000 based
Jazz system to the R4000 base Jazz system. This requires a rewrite of
the trap handling code, an update to the memory management code, and an
update to the interlocked operations.</p>
<p>3. ANSI terminal support for character mode APPs in the keyboard,
mouse, and display drivers.</p>
<p>4. A port and verification of all the above development utilities and
tools to the MIPS environment. This includes the 386/486 C compiler and
386/486 assembler.</p>
<p>5. The MIPS C compiler with structured exception handling.</p>
<p>6. The MIPS assembler.</p>
<p>7. A MIPS user mode debugger.</p>
<p>8. An OS/2 hosted MIPS kernel debugger.</p>
<p>9. A Sonic chip NDIS driver.</p>
<p>10. A port and verification of the redirector and NetBeui
transport.</p>
<p>The <strong>NT</strong> group will deliver all of these components
except the 386/486 C compiler, 386/486 assembler, the MIPS user mode
debugger, and the OS/2 hosted MIPS kernel debugger which are being
delivered by the <strong>Microsoft</strong> Languages Group.</p>
<p>\A schedule commmitment is required from the languages group for
support of an NT OS/2 hosted 386/486 C compiler, 386/486 assembler, and
a MIPS user mode debugger.\</p>
<p>Four people from the <strong>NT</strong> group will be responsible
for pulling together the actual system and verifying its operation over
a 6-8 week period. These people are tentatively identified as Markl,
Davegi, Tomm, and Larryo. Kylesh from the testing group will be the
offical build resource and will be responsible for maintaining the build
and maintenance trees.</p>
<p>The target data for the self hosted MIPS system is <strong>April 25,
1991</strong>.</p>
<p>Meeting the target date assumes that a MIPS compiler will be
available on the DECstation 5000 by <strong>December 1, 1990</strong>
that fully supports structured exception handling and a Microsoft C
compatible packed pragma.</p>
<p>Meeting the target date also assumes that the R3000 based Jazz
hardware will be available for use by the <strong>NT</strong> software
group by <strong>December 1, 1990</strong> and that the R4000 based Jazz
system will be available by <strong>February 1, 1991</strong>.</p>
<p>\We will have to decide how to split the source tree for multiple
targets within one architecture. Currently this is done via conditional
compilation, but the differences between the R3000 and R4000 based Jazz
system will be too great to use this methodology.\</p>
<p>\A ported set of Windows 32-bit base system API tests should be
available for testing this system. What other tests should be
available?\</p>
<p>\A complete set of network aware file tests should be available.\</p>
<p>\File system and file server stress tests should be available.\</p>
<h2 id="windows-based-self-hosted-386486-and-mips-system">4.3. Windows
Based Self Hosted 386/486 and MIPS System</h2>
<p>The windows based self hosted system adds Windows support for an ANSI
terminal window and allows the phase over from the interim ANSI terminal
capabilites to a fully windowed system. This system will be supported on
both 386/486 and MIPS platforms and will form the development
environment for the components and capabilities needed for the Beta Test
SDK system.</p>
<p>The Windows based self hosted system will contain the following
additional capabilities and components:</p>
<p>1. ANSI terminal support in a window.</p>
<p>2. The GDI subset required for window support.</p>
<p>3. The user window manager.</p>
<p>4. The program manager in the shell.</p>
<p>5. Kernel and DDI level device drivers for the Jazz and 386/486
display, keyboard, and mouse that have the interim ANSI terminal support
removed.</p>
<p>6. The resource compiler.</p>
<p>\What other tools and capabilities are needed?\</p>
<p>\What is the debugging environment for windows apps? Is it 3.1
compatible? Does it require a separate terminal?\</p>
<p>\The 32-bit thunks kit would help the development of Windows 32-bit
APPs before the full windowing environment is available.\</p>
<p>The target date for the self hosted windows system is <strong>May 1,
1991</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="beta-test-sdk">5. Beta Test SDK</h1>
<p>The Beta Test SDK will be a formally packaged system that is
distributed to a selected set of ISVs and hardware OEMs wishing to
develop device drivers. It will be supported on a selected 486 platform
and the Jazz MIPS platform.</p>
<p>It will contain preliminary installation and configuration management
software.</p>

Product/Major Milestone Descriptions and Schedules</h1>
<p>The development strategy that is being followed is to</p>
<p>The next major milestone in the development of <strong>NT
OS/2</strong> will be the ability of the operating system to host its
own development. This is planned to be operational on both the x86 and
the MIPS RISC PC in Q1'91.</p>
<p>This milestone will be followed by a beta quality field test SDK that
will be available on the MIPS RISC PC and Compaq 486 systems in
Q3'91.</p>
<p>The first retail product will be a MIPS RISC PC that supports the
Windows 32-bit APIs, is network enabled, provides a robust and secure
operating environment, and is capable of competing with UN*X systems. A
secondary goal for this product is the support for Compaq 486 systems.
The target date for this product is Q1'92.</p>
<p>The second retail product is aimed at providing a robust and secure
platform for scalable performance LanMan servers. This release will
support multi-processor 486 systems (possibly also MIPS RISC
multi-processor systems as well) and will support all the network
services and NDIS drivers necessary to compete with Novell on 386 and
486 systems. The target date for this product is H2'92.</p>
<p>The third retail product is aimed at providing a full workstation
capability for 368 and 486 systems that is certifiably secure, contains
support for DOS and Windows 16-bit applications, and also supports the
OS/2 32-bit base system APIs. The target date for this product is
somtime in 93.</p>
<p>What products have an OAK? DDK?</p>
<h1 id="project-goals">8. Project Goals</h1>
<h1 id="dependencies-3">9. Dependencies</h1>
<p>The <strong>NT</strong> operating system products are dependent on
several groups to provide necessary components for the various product
releases.</p>
<h2 id="languages-group">9.1. Languages Group</h2>
<p>The <strong>NT</strong> effort is dependent on the languages group to
deliver the necessary programming tools for the 386, 486, and MIPS
platforms to support self hosted development.</p>
<p>Programming tools to be supplied by the languages group are split
into two groups; those required for 386 and 486 development, and those
required for MIPS development. All tools must be ported to the
<strong>NT</strong> environment and run under the <strong>NT</strong>
operating system.</p>
<p>The following is a list of the 386 and 486 tools to be delivered by
the languages group:</p>
<p>76. C compiler with structured exception handling.</p>
<p>77. x86 Assembler.</p>
<p>78. Linker capable of producing <strong>NT</strong> format
images.</p>
<p>79. User debugger capable of supporting multi-thread debugging.</p>
<p>80. Kernel debugger capable of supporting multi-processor
debugging.</p>
<p>The following is a list of the MIPS tools to be delivered by the
languages group:</p>
<p>81. User debugger capable of supporting multi-thread debugging.</p>
<p>82. Kernel debugger capable of supporting multi-processor
debugging.</p>
<p>The languages group is also planning to deliver a C compiler for MIPS
that supports structured exception handling. However, this compiler will
not be available for use in time to support the self hosting of
<strong>NT</strong> development. Therefore, the MIPS C compiler, which
also supports structured exception handling, is being ported to the
<strong>NT</strong> environment as a backup.</p>
