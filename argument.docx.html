<h1 id="overview">1. Overview</h1>
<p>This document describes the argument probing and capture requirements
to which all system services must adhere.</p>
<p>System services must be written such that they are robust and provide
protection against malicious attack and inadvertent program bugs. It
must not be possible to crash or corrupt the system by passing an
invalid argument value, a pointer to memory that is not accessible to
the caller, or by dynamically altering or deleting the memory occupied
by an argument in a simultaneously executing thread.</p>
<h1 id="requirements">2. Requirements</h1>
<p>Every system service must ensure that the arguments on which it
operates are valid (i.e., values are correct). This is essential to
robust system operation and involves the capturing of values and the
probing of argument addresses at appropriate points.</p>
<p>In general, a system service should capture all arguments on entry to
the procedure. This ensures that the caller or one of its cohorts (buddy
threads) cannot dynamically alter the value of the argument after it has
been read and verified, or delete the memory in which it is
contained.</p>
<p>In some cases, it is not necessary to capture the value of an
argument immediately. Such is the case for I/O buffers and name strings.
However, all pointers <strong>MUST</strong> be captured and the
addresses to which they point <strong>MUST</strong> be probed for
accessibility.</p>
<p>Fortunately, most arguments do not need explicit capture since they
are passed in registers. Arguments that are passed in memory are probed
and captured by the system service dispatcher as necessary.</p>
<h1 id="operation">3. Operation</h1>
<p>The address space layout of <strong>Windows NT</strong> contains a
boundary that delineates user address space from system address space.
All addresses above the boundary are considered system addresses and all
addresses below the boundary are considered user addresses.</p>
<p>Pages in the system part of the address space are owned by kernel
mode and are not accessible to the user unless they are double mapped
into the user part of the address space. Pages in the user part of the
address space are owned by user mode and the access for kernel mode is
identical to that for user mode.</p>
<p>The executive <strong>NEVER</strong> creates a page in the user part
of the address space that is owned by kernel mode. Furthermore, at the
boundary between user address space and system address space, there are
<strong>64K</strong> bytes that are inaccessible to all modes. This
address space layout makes it possible to determine whether an address
is a valid user address simply by doing a boundary comparison.</p>
<p>When a system service is called, the trap handler gets control, saves
state, and transfers control to the system service dispatcher. The
system service dispatcher determines which system service is being
called, and obtains the address of the appropriate function and the
number of in-memory arguments from a dispatch table. If the previous
processor mode is user mode and there is one or more in-memory
arguments, then the in-memory argument list is probed and then copied to
the kernel stack. If an access violation occurs during the copy, then
the system service is completed with a status of access violation. If an
access violation does not occur, then the the pointer to the in-memory
argument list is changed to point to the copy of the arguments on the
kernel stack. The system service dispatcher sets up a catchall condition
handler, and then calls the system service function.</p>
<p>The first thing the system service should do is establish a condition
handler. This handler should be prepared to handle access violations
that may occur as argument pointers are dereferenced to read or write
actual argument values.</p>
<p>Next, the system service code should obtain the previous processor
mode. If the previous processor mode was kernel, then there is no need
to probe any arguments. The executive does not call itself with bad
arguments.</p>
<p>If the previous processor mode was user, then any argument values
that are read or written by dereferencing a pointer must be probed for
accessibility. Probing is accomplished by first ensuring that the
address of the variable is within the user's address space and then
reading or writing the variable as appropriate. The code that actually
probes pointer-related arguments does not set up a condition handler. It
merely does the boundary check and then reads or writes the indicated
location. If the boundary check fails, an access violation condition is
raised. If the memory is inaccessible, an access violation is raised by
hardware. Thus probes are extremely cheap.</p>
<p>The complete code at the beginning of a system service should be
constructed as follows:</p>
<p><strong>// set up condition handler to catch access
violations</strong></p>
<p><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>if (GetPreviousMode() != KernelMode) {</strong></p>
<p><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>// probe and capture reference arguments</strong></p>
<p><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>}</strong></p>
<p>At this point in the execution of a system service, all input values
have been captured and all output variables have been probed for
writeability. The system service performs its function, writes output
values as necessary, and returns a status that indicates whether the
service succeeded or failed.</p>
<p>During the writing of output values, an access violation can occur
because another thread or user altered the address space of the calling
thread. Access violations that occur at this time are silent and do not
cause the service to fail. If this were not the case, then it would be
very difficult to actually complete a system service since code would
have to be added to back out and undo the service right up until the
very last output value is written. If the caller receives a success
status under such conditions, it is likely that the caller will attempt
to access one of the output values and get an access violation.</p>
<h1 id="interfaces">4. Interfaces</h1>
<p>The following sections describe the interfaces that are provided to
probe arguments for read and write accessibility.</p>
<h2 id="probe-for-readability-and-read-argument-value">4.1 Probe for

on procedure entry or which has been previously captured with one of the
these functions. The functions compare the pointer value to the
user/system address boundary, read the appropriate data-type value, and
return the value as the function value. If the value is not of
consequence, then the function value is simply not assigned to a

<p>The previous functions are used to probe for writeability and read a
value pointed to by a safe pointer. A safe pointer is one that has
either been captured on procedure entry or which has been previously
captured with one of these functions. The functions compare the pointer
value to the user/system address boundary, read the appropriate data
type value, write the value that was read back into memory, and return
the original value as the function value. If the value is not of
consequence, then the function value is simply not assigned to a
variable. Note that both signed and unsigned data types are

<p>The previous functions are used to probe a primitive data type for
writeability and read a value pointed to by a safe pointer. In addition,
the value that is to be written is specified as an argument to the
function. A safe pointer is one that has either been captured on
procedure entry or which has been previously captured with one of these
functions. The functions compare the pointer value to the user/system
address boundary, read the appropriate data-type value, write the
specified value to memory, and return the original memory contents as
the function value. If the value is not of consequence, then the
function value is simply not assigned to a variable. Note that both
signed and unsigned data types are provided.</p>
<h2 id="probing-an-aggregate-value">4.4 Probing An Aggregate Value</h2>

<p><strong>VOID</strong></p>
<p><strong>ProbeForWrite (</strong></p>
<p><strong>IN PCHAR Address,</strong></p>
<p><strong>IN ULONG Length</strong></p>

<p>The previous functions are used to probe an aggregate for read or
write accessibility using a safe pointer. A safe pointer is one that has
either been captured on procedure entry or which has been previously
captured with one of the preceding functions. The functions compare the
starting and ending addresses of the specified aggregate for read or
write accessibility and then read or write one character from each page
that is spanned by the aggregate. Note that these functions do not
capture the aggregate value.</p>
