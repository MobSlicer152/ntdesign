<h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>This document describes the NT Base group deliverables for the
<strong>NT OS</strong> for four product releases:</p>
<p>o beta testing SDK kit for RISC and 486</p>
<p>o retail product for MIPS and 486 workstation (includes retail SDK
kit).</p>
<p>o retail product for RISC, uniprocessor 486, and 486 mutliprocessor
servers</p>
<p>o retail product for 486 workstation which includes MVDM and Win-16
support.</p>
<p>Note that 386 workstations will be supported (B6 stepping and above),
but they will not have kernel support for correcting the deficiencies in
i386 memory management. This deficiency manifests itself by allowing one
thread to change the page protection on a page to read-only and having
another thread (which is executing a kernel service) write to that page.
The 486 has hardware support to honor page protections in kernel
mode.</p>
<p>The Base group is responsible for those portions of <strong>NT
OS</strong> which do not include networking or windowing, for example,
device drivers, files systems, scheduler, loader.</p>
<h1 id="internal-development-workstation">2. Internal development
workstation</h1>
<p>Allows self-hosting of NT on an NT workstation. This includes
CMD.EXE, compiler, assembler, linker, SLM, editor (MEP), redirector, and
other tools.</p>
<p>As the windowing environment will still be under development, a
stopgap character mode window driver will be developed which will allow
the VGA on the 386/486 and frame buffer on JAZZ to appear as an ANSI
terminal device. This allows character based applications to operate
using the graphics device as an output device. The ANSI terminal
emulation will be incorporated into the Windows environment for the SDK
release. This support is described in the document titled <em><u>NT
Console Interface Specification</u></em>.</p>
<h1 id="beta-testing-sdk-kit-includes-ddk"><br />
3. Beta testing SDK kit (includes DDK)</h1>
<p>The beta testing SDK kit contains the basic features of <strong>NT
OS</strong> to allow ISVs and OEMs to begin developing applications and
device drivers targeted specifically at Win-32 and/or NT.</p>
<h2 id="api-sets">3.1 API Sets</h2>
<p>The following API sets are provided (including necessary header files
for C language):</p>
<p>Win-32 Base API - provides the 32-bit interface for integrating with
the base operating system. These APIs are described in the document
titled <em>Win32 Base APIs</em> and are designed as a logical extension
to the Windows 3.0 Base APIs thereby allowing a straightforward
conversion of software developed for Windows 3.0. This same API set is
offered on the 32-bit version of Windows.</p>
<p>NT Native API - this is the underlying API set for NT. It is
currently undecided if this API set is formally documented, though
certain features may be provided through an "NT Extension" API set. One
such feature which would improve server based applications is
asynchronous I/O. <em>Issue: if the NT API set is provided,
documentation must exist.</em></p>
<p>Device Drivers - this is the "public executive" (device helper) API
set exposed by NT kernel mode components. The User Ed group is
developing documentation for device driver developers. The <strong>NT
Design Workbook</strong> specifies the device driver model and interface
in documents titled <em><u>NT OS Driver Model Specification</u></em> and
<em><u>NT OS I/O System Specification</u></em>.</p>
<h2 id="subsystems">3.2 Subsystems</h2>
<p>The <strong>NT OS</strong> base provides a number of subsystems which
act as servers for various applications. Subsystems operate as user mode
processes but may have amplified privileges beyond the client
application. This allows subsystems to manage global state, open key
files, and manage critical resources on behalf of its clients.</p>
<p>The following subsystems exist in the <strong>NT OS</strong>
base:</p>
<p>o Session Manager - provides a mechanism to start processes executing
images which were developed for a different API environment then the
current process. For example, a POSIX application can "exec" an image
which was developed with the OS/2 API set. The session manager is
describes in a document titled <em><u>NT OS Session Management and
Control</u></em>.</p>
<p>o Security</p>
<p>o Local Security Authority - maintains security policy information,
including list of privileged users, audit control, and security domain
membership. This is described in a document titled <em><u>NT OS Local
Security Specification</u></em>.</p>
<p>o Security Account Manager - maintains user and group account
information as described in the document <em><u>NT OS Security Account
Manager Protected Server (SAM)</u></em>.</p>
<p>o Loader - provides mechanism for locating DLLs, translating symbol
names to executable images, and other DLL related functions.</p>
<p>o Windows Base - provide mechanism for maintaining shared state
between window processes and groups. The functionality provided by this
subsystem may be moved to the subsystem which provides windows graphic
support.</p>
<p>o Debug - provides dispatching of debug events. This subsystem is
described in the document titled <em><u>NT OS Debug
Architecture</u></em>.</p>
<p><em>Issue: Is DOS emulation required on the RISC/PC? How about Win-16
emulation?</em></p>
<h2 id="file-systems">3.3 File Systems</h2>
<p>o FAT - supports the FAT file format. This allows floppy disks to be
exchanged between NT and DOS. The overall file system design is
described in the document titled <em><u>NT File System Design
Note</u></em>.</p>
<p>o HPFS - supports the HPFS file format as defined by OS/2 v1.21.</p>
<p>o NTFS - supports the NT native fully recoverable file system. This
file system provides enhanced data integrity features to provide basic
support for transactions. The NTFS is described in the document titled
<em><u>NT Recoverable File System Specification.</u></em></p>
<p>o CD-ROM - supports the ISO CD-ROM file format.</p>
<p>o NPFS - supports named pipes. The named pipe file system is
described in the document titled <em><u>NT Named Pipe File
Specification</u></em>.</p>
<p>o BOOT - supports multiple boot partitions and allows new file
formats to be bootable as described in the <em><u>NT Boot
Architecture</u></em>.</p>
<h2 id="device-drivers">3.4 Device Drivers</h2>
<p>Device drivers provide the necessary logic to bind the I/O functions
to a physical device. <strong>NT OS</strong> supplies the proper
mechanisms to allow drivers to be loaded either at system initialization
or later once the system is operational.</p>
<h3 id="mips-r4000-pc-drivers">3.4.1 MIPS R4000 PC drivers:</h3>

properly</p>
<p>o MCA support - verification driver to show that MCA functions
properly</p>
<h2 id="fault-tolerance">3.5 Fault tolerance</h2>
<p>For systems with battery backed up memory, power fail recovery is
supported. This support involves saving volatile hardware registers and
caches into RAM during loss of power and restoring the system state when
power is regained. At restoration time, all drivers requesting powerfail
notification are notified and any I/O operations in progress are
restarted by the drivers.</p>
<h2 id="language-support">3.6 Language support</h2>
<h2 id="mips-support">3.7 MIPS support</h2>
<p>o C compiler for MIPS (from either MS or MIPS)</p>
<p>o MIPS assembler for R4000 (only runs on RISC/PC)</p>
<p>o Linker for R4000 (provided by NT/Base group)</p>
<p>o Debugger similar to symdeb</p>
<p>o Kernel debugger for device driver ISV's (requires separate host
machine, currently running OS/2)</p>
<p>o C Run time libraries for Win-32 applications</p>
<p>o Cross development tools for 486 development:</p>
<p>o C6.0 compiler</p>
<p>o MASM Assembler</p>
<p>o Linker for 486 modules. Current plan is for the NT native linker to
support both MIPS and 486 OMFs (Object Module Formats).</p>
<h2 id="intel-486-support">3.8 Intel 486 support</h2>
<p>o C6.0 compiler</p>
<p>o MASM Assembler</p>
<p>o Linker for 486 modules.</p>
<p>o Debugger similar to symdeb</p>
<p>o Kernel debugger for device driver ISV's (requires host machine,
currently OS/2).</p>
<p><em>Issue: the kernel debugger should be ported to the Win-32
environment at a minimum and possibly to the Win-16 environment. Porting
to the Win-16 environment provides the least disruption to the target
audience.</em></p>
<p>o C Run time libraries for Win-32 applications</p>
<h2 id="hardware-booting-support">3.9 Hardware booting support</h2>
<p>The following platforms are being utilized for development and/or
testing and as such hardware booting support and configuration will be
provided.</p>
<p>o Power PC/RISC (Jazz)</p>
<p>o Compaq Deskpro-486 (EISA)</p>
<p>For 386 environments, Intel 387 floating point emulation is provided
for system without 387 coprocessors.</p>
<h2 id="installation-setup">3.10 Installation / Setup</h2>
<p>The beta SDK release will have minimal installation / setup support.
This includes support for building a bootable system from a floppy disk
kit and copying the appropriate SDK header files and utilities to the
hard disk.</p>
<h2 id="performance-utilities">3.11 Performance utilities</h2>
<p>The beta SDK will have basic performance utilities.</p>
<p>o profiler - provides mechanism to obtain a time sampled PC
histogram. The profiler is implemented like a debugger; no changes are
required to the application to enable profiling. The profiler operates
in its own address space and creates profiling objects on behalf of the
process being profiled. When the process completes, the profiler closes
the profile objects and analyzes the collected data. The beta SDK
version of the profiler will not be GUI based. The profiler
fucntionality is not currently documented.</p>
<p>o show system information - shows the current resource usage, active
processes, active threads, etc. within the system. The show system
functionality is not currently documented.</p>
<h2 id="development-utilities">3.12 Development utilities</h2>

<h1 id="retail-product-for-riscpc-includes-an-sdk"><br />
4. Retail Product for RISC/PC (includes an SDK)</h1>
<p>The retail product for RISC/PC includes the final version of the
components provided in the beta SDK release plus installation/setup
features, POSIX compliance and security at the C2 level.</p>
<h2 id="api-sets-1">4.1 API Sets</h2>
<p>Same as beta SDK with addition of POSIX support.</p>
<p>POSIX 1003.1 API - provides the POSIX compliant APIs. These APIs are
defined by the <em>IEEE 1003.1 POSIX specification</em>. The APIs
supported are the minimum set required for to obtain POSIX
certification, i.e., none of the optional APIs will be supported.</p>
<h2 id="subsystems-1">4.2 Subsystems</h2>
<p>Same as Beta SDK with the addition of POSIX.</p>
<p>o POSIX - provides support for all processes executing the POSIX API
set.</p>
<h2 id="device-drivers-1">4.3 Device Drivers</h2>
<p>Same as beta SDK.</p>
<h2 id="file-systems-1">4.4 File Systems</h2>

<p>Complete installation / setup support including configuration
management. The documentation for installation and system management is
currently under development.</p>
<p>o Architecture dependent kernel routines</p>
<p>o System configuration / configuration management</p>
<p>o System management</p>
<p>o Error log reporting mechanism. This is a character mode application
that allows error log reports to be generated based on error type, time,
and device type. For example, list all Fatal errors on device Harddisk0
between Jan 1 1990 12:00 and Jan 1 1990 18:00.</p>
<p>o System crash dump and analysis utility. This provides a mechanism
to dump the contents of physical memory to a file on the disk in the
case of a system crash. When the system is rebooted, the analysis
utility allows the cause of the crash to be analyzed. In severe cases,
crash dump contents may be copied to floppy or tape and sent to product
support specialists for analysis.</p>
<p>o File backup on SCSI tape. This utility provides the ability to
backup and restore complete volumes or selected files onto tape.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Issue</em>: <em>does this need to be SYTRON compatible to provide
the ability to read files written on an OS/2 system? How about just
supporting TAR format??</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>o Application installation - provides a mechanism to install
application software on an NT system.</p>
<p>o National Language Support (NLS) - provides a mechanism for
tailoring an NT system to a specific language environment.</p>
<p>o Shutdown - allow orderly shutdown of the system as a reasonable
alternative to Ctrl-Alt-Del. The shutdown mechanism flushes file caches,
terminates network connects, and does an orderly shutdown of the
system.</p>
<h2 id="security">4.9 Security </h2>
<p><strong>NT OS</strong> provides security features to allow the base
operating system to be certified at the C2 level (discretionary access
control) for the first product release, and eventually at the B1 level.
In order to gain certifications certain features and utilities must be
present in the system to allow the detection and analysis of break-in
attempts and suspected attempts. In addition, a mechanism must be
provided to allow users to display and manipulate security information
on objects, most notably files.</p>
<p>The following components are provided to support security:</p>
<p><u>User Interface:</u></p>
<p>User Account Manager - This utility is based upon the LAN Manager 3.0
User Account Manager utility. It includes minor extensions to support
administration of Security Account Manager concepts that don't exist in
LAN Manager.</p>
<p>Local Security Manager - This utility allows the security parameters
of each NT system to be administered. This is a new utility with no
corresponding LAN Manager functionality. This utility will utilize the
Local Security Manager DLL described below.</p>
<p>Win32 Logon User Interface - This is the user interface presented at
logon time. It collects the user name and password and prevents password
stealing by unauthorized processes. This UI is projected by the Win32
logon process described below.</p>
<p>Win32 File Browser extensions - The Win32 File Browser will be
extended to support security by:</p>
<p>- Displaying security of files and directories upon request.</p>
<p>- Allow modification of file and directory protection and auditing
requirements (using the Object Security editor DLL described below).</p>
<p>- Allow modification of file and directory owner values.</p>
<p>The Win32 Shell will allow a user to establish security
<em>personas</em> and to modify the user's active security persona. This
will allow the user to perform actions such as changing default
protection or enabling and disabling privileges.</p>
<p>Some aspects of installation will deal with establishing the
customer's mode of operation (secure or non-secure) and collecting
security parameters, if running securely. A secure system may also have
to convert a LAN Manager UAS database to a Security Account Manager
database.</p>
<p>Some aspects of configuration control will deal with the security
attributes associated with components of the configured system. For
example, protected subsystems, such as the NT Session Manager, may be
assigned privileges to be run with.</p>
<p><u>Runtime Library &amp; Client Stubs:</u></p>
<p>Runtime Library routines will be included for the manipulation of
security data structures, such as access control lists.</p>
<p>Client RPC stubs will be included for Security Account Manager
services, making the security Account Manager a network-wide service.
This allows administration of security accounts from remote nodes.</p>
<p>Client RPC stubs will be included for Local Security Authority
services, making the Local Security Authority a network-wide service.
This allows administration of individual system security from remote
nodes.</p>
<p><u>Executable Images And DLLs:</u></p>
<p>Security Account Manager protected subsystem image (sam.exe). This
image is run as a native NT protected subsystem. It services user/group
account administration requests, as well as user authentication
requests. This image will only be run on Domain Controller nodes.</p>
<p>Local Security Authority protected subsystem (lsa.exe). This image is
run as a native NT protected subsystem. This image is responsible or
maintaining and enforcing all security policy for an individual system,
such as what audit messages to generate. This protected subsystem will
be active on each NT system.</p>
<p>Win32 Logon Process (w32logon.exe). This image is responsible for
monitoring Win32 for logon requests, and processing them when received.
It prevents Trojan programs from stealing user passwords. This is a
customer modifiable or replaceable module and we will ship the source
code for this module. This image will be active on each NT system.</p>
<p>Local Security Manager DLL (lsm.dll). This DLL provides Win32 user
Interface screens for administering the local system security. This is
implemented as a DLL to allow this functionality to be activated from a
number of related UI utilities (such as the security account
administrator).</p>
<p>Object Security Editor DLL (objsec.dll). This DLL provides object
protection viewing and modification capabilities. It is implemented as a
DLL to allow a standard view of object security to be used anyplace it
is needed. For example, the file browser will use this DLL for file and
directory protection modification and the Security Account Manager will
use this DLL for user and group account protection modification.</p>
<h2 id="performance-utilities-1">4.10 Performance utilities</h2>
<p>Same as beta SDK with a GUI interface to show system information
utility.</p>
<h2 id="development-utilities-1">4.11 Development utilities</h2>
