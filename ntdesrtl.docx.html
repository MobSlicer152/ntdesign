<h1 id="the-nt-os2-mission">1. The NT OS/2 Mission </h1>
<p>The <strong>NT OS/2</strong> group was formed with a clear
mission:</p>
<p>o To design and implement an OS/2-compatible operating system for
non-x86 hardware platforms</p>
<p>o To support the APIs required by POSIX (IEEE Std 1003.1-1988) at a
level required to pass government validation</p>
<p>o To support symmetric multiprocessing</p>
<p>o To provide C2 security features with a path to B1 and beyond</p>
<p>o To provide easy portability to other 32-bit architectures</p>
<p>o To design and implement the first functional system by the 3rd
quarter of 1990</p>
<p>o To target the system for a <strong>Microsoft</strong>-designed i860
PC hardware platform, followed shortly thereafter by an i860mp or N11
multi-processor server system</p>
<p>Conclusions from the January 1989 System Retreat indicated that
<strong>NT OS/2</strong> is critical to the long-term growth of
<strong>Microsoft</strong>. The design of the system must accommodate
current and future needs of <strong>Microsoft</strong>. The design must
be maintainable, and easily extensible.</p>
<h1 id="design-goals">2. Design Goals </h1>
<p>In order to achieve our mission, the following set of prioritized
goals was established:</p>
<p>1. Robustness. The highest priority for <strong>NT OS/2</strong> is
robustness. The inner workings of the system should be straightforward
and well defined. A complete and formal design on all components of the
system must be produced and interfaces and behavior must be well
specified. The system must be designed without "magic".</p>
<p>2. Extensibility and maintainability. <strong>NT OS/2</strong> must
be designed with the future in mind. It should be easily extensible to
meet the needs of our OEM customers and our own needs over time. The
system should also be designed for maintainability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the state of the API sets that <strong>NT OS/2</strong> must
support, its design must accommodate changes and future additions to
those sets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3. Portability. <strong>NT OS/2</strong> must be designed for
portability. The system architecture must be portable across a number of
platforms. There are portions of the actual implementation that will
require a port when moving from platform to platform. The effort
required to port <strong>NT OS/2</strong> from one platform to another
must be less than, or equal to, an equivalent port of a UNIX or Mach
system.</p>
<p>4. Performance. Superior performance in <strong>NT OS/2</strong> is
important. Algorithms and data structures that will lead to a high level
of performance and that will provide us with the flexibility needed to
achieve our other goals must be incorporated into the design. The
granularity of locking, the various types of locks used in the system,
the amount of time spent at an elevated interrupt level or with
interrupts completely disabled must be carefully designed so that
<strong>NT OS/2</strong> is a responsive system which can compete in a
number of markets.</p>
<p>In addition to these goals, compatibility with OS/2 APIs and POSIX
compliance are system constraints in <strong>NT OS/2</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="design-alternatives-investigated">3. Design Alternatives
Investigated </h1>
<p>Several design alternatives for <strong>NT OS/2</strong> were
considered during the design phase.</p>
<p>The first design layered the POSIX API set on top of a slightly
extended OS/2 API set. As the design progressed, it became apparent that
this design would lead to a system that could not achieve the goals of
robustness, maintainability, or extensibility. Problems encountered with
a similar attempt in OS/2 led to considerable change in the base system
capabilities, which further strengthened the belief that this was a poor
alternative.</p>
<p>The next design implemented both OS/2 and POSIX API sets directly in
the <strong>NT OS/2</strong> executive. This was an improvement on the
previous design, but the large number of "chicken wire" and "voodoo"
interfaces required by this design threatened the goals of extensibility
and maintainability.</p>
<p>The third design implemented OS/2 and POSIX as protected subsystems
outside the <strong>NT OS/2</strong> executive. Success with this type
of client/server architecture in the academic community and at other
research sites provides strong evidence that this design will allow
<strong>NT OS/2</strong> to meet its goals of robustness, extensibility,
maintainability, portability, and performance, and thus, achieve its
mission. Therefore, this design was chosen for <strong>NT
OS/2</strong>.</p>
<p>(The final section of this document examines the three <strong>NT
OS/2</strong> design alternatives in greater detail.)</p>
<h1 id="the-nt-os2-design">4. The NT OS/2 Design</h1>
<p>The <strong>NT OS/2</strong> system design consists of a highly
functional executive, which executes in kernel mode, and exports a
native API (a set of system services). Operating system environments
such as OS/2 and POSIX are implemented as protected subsystems outside
the executive.</p>
<p>A protected subsystem executes in user mode as a regular (native)
process. The subsystem may have amplified privileges, but it is not
considered a part of the executive and, therefore, cannot bypass the
system security architecture, or in any other way corrupt the system.
Subsystems communicate with their clients and each other using a
high-performance local (cross-process) procedure call, or LPC,
mechanism. (A round-trip LPC completes in approximately 100usec on the
i860.)</p>
<p>This <strong>NT OS/2</strong> design satisfies each of the goals for
the system. The following attributes of the design ensure the primary
goal of robustness:</p>
<p>o The kernel mode portion of the system exports well-defined APIs
that, in general, do not have mode parameters or other "magical flags".
Therefore, the APIs are simple to implement, easy to test, and easy to
document.</p>
<p>o A formal design is being produced for all portions of the
<strong>NT OS/2</strong> system prior to coding. This effort has led to
well-documented interfaces for native services and internal
functions.</p>
<p>o The partitioning of major components, such as PM, OS/2, and POSIX,
into separate subsystems is resulting in simple, elegant designs in the
subsystems. Each subsystem is optimized to implement only those features
needed to provide its API set.</p>
<p>o With the prevalent use of frame-based exception handlers,
<strong>NT OS/2</strong> and its subsystems are able to catch
programming errors and filter bad or inaccessible parameters in an
efficient and reliable manner.</p>
<p>The <strong>NT OS/2</strong> design also meets its goals of
maintainability and extensibility through the following features:</p>
<p>o The <strong>NT OS/2</strong> design is simple and well documented.
This, coupled with a common coding standard used throughout the system,
should enable a programmer to work on any piece of the system without
having to consult the "gurus" to learn about hidden rules, side effects,
or "magical" programming tricks.</p>
<p>o By using subsystems to implement major portions of the system,
<strong>NT OS/2</strong> isolates and controls dependencies. For
example, the only piece of the <strong>NT OS/2</strong> system affected
by the changing Cruiser design is the OS/2 subsystem. The design of the
process structure, memory management, synchronization primitives, and so
on, does not have to be put on hold. The same holds true for the
evolving POSIX standards.</p>
<p>o As the needs of <strong>Microsoft</strong> grow, the <strong>NT
OS/2</strong> system is prepared to accommodate those needs. Subsystems
that provide additional functionality can be added to the system without
impacting the base system. New subsystems can be added without having to
modify the <strong>NT OS/2</strong> executive or release a new version
of the system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subsystems such as DOS, Windows, or Xenix can be added to the system
if necessary. OEMs could continue to provide limited support for
operating system environments other than the
<strong>Microsoft</strong>-provided OS/2 and POSIX environments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>o Using the subsystem or "building block" approach, it is possible to
envision a configuration that includes only the OS/2 subsystem. POSIX
could be a revenue-producing, licensable option. If the option were not
used, no system resources would be sacrificed.</p>
<p>o Subsystems need not bypass the security features present in
<strong>NT OS/2</strong>. Rather, they can use the security features to
their fullest extent.</p>
<p><strong>NT OS/2</strong> portability is ensured by the following:</p>
<p>o Except for small, well-isolated sections of code, <strong>NT
OS/2</strong> is written in C. The system is being developed on
prototype compilers with limited functionality, and still, the design
has yielded portable code.</p>
<p>o Using the UNIX and Mach porting experience of engineers on the
project, the group has established that the <strong>NT OS/2</strong>
will port to other platforms at least as easily as the UNIX or Mach
operating systems. The effort involved in porting <strong>NT
OS/2</strong> to another 32-bit, paged architecture, using readily
available compilers, is small.</p>
<p><strong>NT OS/2</strong> is a high-performance system designed to run
on high-performance hardware. We believe that the system will perform
better than any system providing equivalent functionality on equivalent
hardware. The following attributes of the system promote high
performance:</p>
<p>o Algorithms and execution paths through the system have been
carefully optimized to increase performance. Also, the modular nature of
the system allows performance optimization by replacing entire
components.</p>
<p>o System calls, exceptions (page faults), LPC, thread creation, and
I/O have undergone scrutiny to ensure their speed. The round-trip time
for a null system call is currently on the order of 3usec (on a 40Mhz
i860). Given this number, <strong>NT OS/2</strong> performs better than
most systems even after equalizing processor speeds.</p>
<p>o Ensuring high performance is an ongoing activity in the
implementation of <strong>NT OS/2</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="performance-in-the-subsystem-model">5. Performance in the
Subsystem Model</h1>
<p>Before committing the <strong>NT OS/2</strong> design to a subsystem,
or client/server model, time was spent analyzing the Presentation
Manager. One of the deficiencies in the current implementation of PM is
that it must manage global state without having any way to protect the
state. We worked with one of the designers and implementors of PM to
develop a solution to this problem by making PM a protected subsystem
(which executes in its own process context rather than in the context of
the thread that called a PM entry point).</p>
<p>Before proceeding with the PM design, the <strong>NT OS/2</strong>
LPC mechanism was designed. We felt that if the LPC design were solid,
it could be modeled, and we could determine whether or not PM
performance would be acceptable using a subsystem design model.</p>
<p>Ideas present in several high-performance LPC mechanisms were
incorporated into the <strong>NT OS/2</strong> design:</p>
<p>o The ability to efficiently pass small amounts of data, as was done
in Stanford's V system, is included.</p>
<p>o The idea of mapping large messages or passing large parameters
"out-of-band" is similar to the mechanism used in Carnegie Mellon's Mach
system.</p>
<p>o The ability to pass message data through memory shared between the
client application and the subsystem is similar to the technique used in
an experimental system under development at the University of
Washington, and which also appears in DEC's Topaz system.</p>
<p>With the design of the <strong>NT OS/2</strong> LPC mechanism
complete, a model was created to measure the performance impact of
running PM as a protected subsystem.</p>
<p>The model consisted of the following pieces of modified system
software:</p>
<p>o OS/2 Kernel Modifications. A special version of OS/2 1.1 was built.
This version of the system had an additional system service that
simulated a context switch from the calling thread back to the calling
thread.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> All of the work involved in
switching address spaces was simulated as well.</p>
<p>o <em>pmwin.dll</em> and <em>pmgpi.dll</em>. A new version of each of
these libraries was created. For each entry point, the cost of
marshalling its parameters into and out of a message buffer was
simulated; two calls to the new context switch routine were done; and
finally, a call was made to the original version of the entry point.</p>
<p>By running PM applications using the modified system software, we
were able to determine exactly how much overhead PM would incur when run
as a subsystem.</p>
<p>Several test cases were run on the model. These included running the
PMBENCH benchmark suite, running PMDRAW and drawing complicated
pictures, running various configurations of PM Excel and scrolling,
drawing charts, and performing other screen manipulations, and finally,
running a journaled interactive session with multiple PM applications
doing different tasks, including menu and dialog box operations.</p>
<p>Before running our tests, we did not know what to expect. We felt
that if the system did not feel sluggish, then the subsystem approach
might be acceptable. After running all of our tests, we were surprised.
The system performed so well that we could not tell the difference
between the subsystem version of PM and the normal version of PM.</p>
<p>The following table shows a condensed listing of our benchmark
results:</p>
<p>LPC PM Standard Subsystem</p>
<p>Overhead PM Time PM Time Difference</p>
<p>PMBENCH Test Suite 5.14% *** *** ***</p>
<p>PMDRAW monticello 16.88% 12.403s 14.497s 2.094s</p>
<p>PMDRAW fish 8.80% 11.887s 12.940s 1.053s</p>
<p>Excel Scroll 1's 3.25% 30.880s 31.885s 1.005s</p>
<p>Excel Scroll Big 0.84% 63.060s 63.590s 0.530s</p>
<p>Excel Chart 9.65% 12.900s 14.145s 1.245s</p>
<p>Interactive 1.20% 335.510s 339.670s 4.160s</p>
<p>=======</p>
<p>Average Overhead 2.16% 466.640s 476.727s 10.087s</p>
<p>From the results of our study, we felt that the additional overhead
imposed by running PM as a protected subsystem was acceptable given the
benefits of such a design. While there is measurable overhead, it is not
detectable when sitting in front of a machine running interactive or
graphics-intensive applications.</p>
<p>After determining that PM could be run as a protected subsystem
without incurring unacceptable performance degradation, we looked at
other areas of the system that would be cleaner to implement as a
separate subsystem but would not impact overall system performance.</p>
<p>Given that OS/2 and POSIX had to be treated as partitioned code
within the executive, they were natural candidates for implementation as
protected subsystems. We believe that real OS/2 (and POSIX) applications
will be more dependent on the performance of PM than any other portion
of the system. The ratio of PM to operating system service calls is
likely to range from 10:1 to 100:1. If PM is a good candidate for
implementation as a protected subsystem, then operating system
environments such as OS/2 or POSIX are also good (if not better)
candidates.</p>
<h1 id="standards">6. Standards </h1>
<p>During the initial design phase of <strong>NT OS/2</strong>, a great
deal of time was spent examining ways to design a system that could
support both the OS/2 and POSIX API sets. This job was complicated by
the fact that both of the API sets we planned to support were moving
targets. In fact, the Cruiser specification was not yet available; it is
still evolving.</p>
<h2 id="os2-standards">6.1 OS/2 Standards </h2>
<p>Our initial OS/2 API set centers around the evolving 32-bit Cruiser,
or OS/2 2.0 API set. (The design of Cruiser APIs is being done in
parallel with the <strong>NT OS/2</strong> design.) In some respects,
this standard is harder to deal with than the POSIX standards. OS/2 is
tied to the Intel x86 architecture and these dependencies show up in a
number of APIs. Given the nature of OS/2 design (the joint development
agreement), we have had little success in influencing the design of the
2.0 APIs so that they are portable and reasonable to implement on
non-x86 systems. In addition, the issue of binary compatibility with
OS/2 arises when the system is back-ported to an 80386 platform. This
may involve 16-bit as well as 32-bit binary compatibility.</p>
<h2 id="posix-standards">6.2 POSIX Standards </h2>
<p>Our initial POSIX efforts center around the IEEE Std 1003.1-1988 (or
Draft 13). The spec is vague in several areas and contains several
optional features.</p>
<p>In order to sell in certain federal government markets, a POSIX
implementation must be compliant with FIPS 151. This FIPS requires that
certain optional features of POSIX be implemented, and also requires
portions of other POSIX standards (1003.2, "Applications and
Utilities"). In addition, the FIPS requires a certification of
conformance. This certificate can be obtained by passing a certified
POSIX test suite. The current set of test suites are developed by third
parties, and do test for compliance with the POSIX spec. Unfortunately
for us, the test suites were developed on UNIX systems that claim POSIX
compliance. The test suites end up testing a lot of UNIX folklore that
happens to be permissible under an interpretation of the POSIX spec.</p>
<p>To further complicate POSIX compliance, additional drafts of 1003.1,
which are close to approval, have been proposed. The effects of approval
are unknown. It is not clear if future additions to POSIX will be
required under future FIPS, or if additions will be made optional. The
government standards body that is issuing the FIPS is apparently ready
to add any approved POSIX drafts to its FIPS. The latest draft under
consideration (1003.1a), would add a number of features from Berkeley
UNIX 4.3 to POSIX. It is anticipated that a new FIPS will be issued
which requires these features in order to participate in certain
government markets.</p>
<h1 id="an-analysis-of-the-design-alternatives">7. An Analysis of the
Design Alternatives </h1>
<p>Once the mission and goals of <strong>NT OS/2</strong> were clear,
the design work was started. The most difficult portion of the design
centered around the issue of how to provide OS/2 and POSIX compliance on
the same system without failing to achieve our mission or compromising
our goals.</p>
<p>Combining the APIs of multiple operating systems in a single system
is always a difficult task. It does not matter whether the APIs are
similar or different. The most striking example of this problem is the
poor integration of UNIX variants found in the current UNIX market.</p>
<p>In the beginning (1982-1984), there were basically two branches in
the UNIX tree. The BSD branch with Berkeley UNIX 4.2 and 4.3, and the
AT&amp;T System V branch with System V.2 and V.3. Companies that offered
pure systems in either camp were the norm. Companies in the scientific
and engineering markets supported BSD while business-oriented companies
supported System V:</p>
<p>o Sun 1.0-2.x was pure BSD</p>
<p>o DEC's ULTRIX was pure BSD</p>
<p>o Sequent was pure System V</p>
<p>o Altos was pure System V</p>
<p>After some time, companies began to offer systems with mixed
features. This began with systems advertising "System V with BSD
networking." Soon, nearly all companies offered systems with some
features from both environments. Applications could call APIs from
either set. If the API specified different behavior for a System V or a
BSD implementation, it was usually a tossup as to which semantics were
followed.</p>
<p>The current state of System V and BSD integration is the root of
nearly all the confusion in the current UNIX marketplace. To port an
application that was originally BSD to a system that is "System V with
BSD features" requires elaborate configuration files that "pick and
choose" the APIs. With each port to a new system, the configuration
options and combinations must be expanded to accommodate the new system.
The popular UNIX editor, emacs, is a perfect example of this. The emacs
editor comes with nearly 50 configuration files. Each file describes a
derivative of UNIX that has different features and supports a certain
mix of BSD and System V APIs.</p>
<p>A major design issue in <strong>NT OS/2</strong> is to avoid the
integration-of-features problem present in the current UNIX marketplace.
<strong>Microsoft</strong> cannot afford to present POSIX and OS/2
integration as poorly as most of the UNIX vendors have.</p>
<p>In the selected <strong>NT OS/2</strong> design, an application that
uses OS/2 APIs may only use OS/2 APIs. The POSIX API set is not
available to the application. The reverse restriction is also true.
POSIX applications may not call OS/2 APIs.</p>
<h2 id="posix-layered-on-os2">7.1 POSIX Layered on OS/2 </h2>
<p>The first alternative examined the feasibility of layering the POSIX
API set as a runtime package on top of a native system service interface
based on an OS/2 API set.</p>
<p>Using this approach, the <strong>NT OS/2</strong> executive would
export an OS/2 2.0 API set. If there were functions that required
extensions in order to make this work, we were prepared to make those
extensions. An example of this approach is supporting POSIX
<em>fork()</em> and <em>exec()</em> using OS/2's DosExecPgm().</p>
<p>We proposed adding a flag to DosExecPgm that would take one of the
following values:</p>
<p>1. The API should work exactly as the current DosExecPgm function
works (that is, a new process is created and its address space is
initialized so that it maps the image specified as the program name
parameter).</p>
<p>2 The API should create a process and the address space should be an
image of the address space of the calling process. Thread 1 should be
created in the new process and its initial context should be identical
to the context of the calling thread at the time of the call. The only
exception is that thread 1 in the new process must return with a
different return value than that returned by the calling thread.</p>
<p>3 The API should clean the address space of the process, terminate
any threads in the process, create a new address space such that it maps
the specified program image file, and create thread 1 so that it begins
execution at the entry point specified in the image.</p>
<p>To implement OS/2 DosExecPgm, the API would be called with flag value
1. POSIX's <em>fork()</em> and <em>exec()</em> would be implemented
using flag values 2 and 3.</p>
<p>On the surface, the above technique seems to work, but it is
complicated. Complications arise in the following areas:</p>
<p>o File descriptors owned by a process would be dealt with differently
in all three variations of DosExecPgm().</p>
<p>o File locks held by the process at the time of the API call would be
handled differently for all three cases. In fact, since file locking
itself is different, the case is really an 8-way case.</p>
<p>o Outstanding timers or process alarms have at least three different
actions.</p>
<p>o Signals pending, or the state of a process's signal or exception
handlers, is affected by the various API options.</p>
<p>The list of problems with this API is large, as should be clear from
the above list. More important, the problem seems to scale
exponentially. Simple operations like opening or creating files,
establishing signal or exception handlers, reading from and writing to
the terminal, or even manipulating regular files all have problems and
virtually all require a mode argument.</p>
<p>One of the other serious problems with this design alternative is
that it presents a poor integration of OS/2 and POSIX. It would be
difficult to separate OS/2 calls from POSIX calls. Multi-threaded OS/2
applications that, either on purpose or as a result of a programming
error, call DosExecPgm specifying a POSIX-oriented option would have
disastrous effects. We could always say that this could not happen, but
in order to achieve the robustness goals of the <strong>NT OS/2</strong>
system, the executive would have to be coded so that it could handle all
possible incorrect parameter combinations.</p>
<p>After determining that layering POSIX on top of OS/2 would bury much
of POSIX in the executive, and would cause most of the overlapping APIs
to require a mode parameter, we looked at ways of implementing the POSIX
API set directly inside the <strong>NT OS/2</strong> executive.</p>
<h2 id="os2-and-posix-in-the-executive">7.2 OS/2 and POSIX in the
Executive </h2>
<p>By implementing both the OS/2 and POSIX API sets directly within the
executive, we were able to work on a layered, controllable design. The
system would yield two API layers, one layer exporting OS/2 APIs and the
other layer exporting POSIX APIs. The API layers would be implemented on
top of an executive support layer.</p>
<p>The executive support layer would implement basic executive services
such as process and address space management, thread
creation/deletion/control, security, an I/O system and a file system.
The executive support layer would control, create, and delete all state
in the system. The API layers would simply call the executive support
layer with appropriate parameters. They would not maintain state.</p>
<p>As we progressed with this design, it became clear that it was nearly
identical to our initial design. Our proposals for the design of the
process structure were not much different from the extensions that we
had planned for DosExecPgm(). The primary difference was that the
parameter combinations passed to the executive layer were controllable.
Since the parameters came from the system code that implemented the API
layers, we were able to make rules and declare that certain parameter
combinations could not occur. This made the executive layer somewhat
easier to write, but the rules for calling the executive became rather
elaborate.</p>
<p>For <strong>NT OS/2</strong> to remain a product that could carry
<strong>Microsoft</strong> through the 1990's, maintainability,
extensibility, and robustness had to be ensured. It seemed that almost
everything became an exception. The well-defined interfaces within the
process structure became littered with exceptions and kludges needed to
support the demands of POSIX's job control option or OS/2's complex
process/command subtree relationships. Simple functions, such as waiting
on a child process (common to both OS/2 and POSIX), became difficult to
implement because the executive had to manage two slightly different
cases.</p>
<p>As each new issue arose, the solution always seemed to have a common
theme...</p>
<p>The terminal driver could look to see if the application writing to
the terminal was a POSIX application. If so, then if the terminal was
not the controlling terminal for the process, but the process was not
ignoring SIGSTOP, then the process could be signaled and its parent
notified.</p>
<p>or...</p>
<p>When a process terminates, look to see if it was an OS/2 application
or if it was a POSIX application. If it was an OS/2 application that was
<em>exec</em>'d using EXEC_SYNC, then after termination is complete, the
process ID is available for re-use. If it was a POSIX application, then
if the parent was not PID 1, signal it. If the process was a session
group leader, then generate a SIGHUP signal to all members of the
session group with the same controlling terminal, and possibly free the
controlling terminal.</p>
<p>The more the design progressed, the more the system started to look
like a bowl of spaghetti. Problems arose due to subtle differences
between OS/2 and POSIX in almost all areas. The following are a few
examples of the problems:</p>
<p>o Process ID (PID). The POSIX job control option (required by FIPS
151) is difficult to implement correctly even on a BSD UNIX system.
Process relationships and the lifetime of a PID are complex. A POSIX PID
has nothing in common with an OS/2 PID other than sharing the same
acronym.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The standard solution to this sort of problem usually involved a
"table off to the side" that could keep track of the differences. We had
"tables off to the side" for POSIX and OS/2 process IDs, POSIX sessions,
job control sessions, controlling terminal IDs, file and file system
serial numbers (device, inode pairs, etc.), and others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>o Exception handling. POSIX requires an exception handling mechanism
based on signals that are similar to signals found in Berkeley UNIX 4.3.
This architecture is drastically different from the current 16-bit OS/2
exception architecture and even more different than portions of the
proposed OS/2 2.0 exception architecture.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The exception architectures of both systems involve large portions of
the entire system. The keyboard, video, and terminal drivers are
involved, as is the process structure, system service dispatcher, trap
handler, and so on.</p>
<p>Trying to tie together these different pieces of the system in a way
in which they could all participate in exception handling was seriously
compromising the design of the system.</p>
<p>The solution to this sort of problem usually involved adding fields
to the process or thread structures to keep track of this. It became
clear that our process and thread structures were going to be large.
Much of the overhead was due to link words and pointers to the "tables
off to the side," or to fields that were needed only if the process or
thread represented a POSIX application (or OS/2 application).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>o Security. POSIX security impacts major pieces of the system. As the
design progressed, it became clear that POSIX security was at odds with
the Cruiser-like security scheme being designed for <strong>NT
OS/2</strong>. Many features of the security scheme would have to be
bypassed in order to implement the "hodge podge" of security
features/APIs that appear in POSIX.</p>
<p>The list of chicken wire fixes is endless. Nearly all areas of the
system are involved, including timers, time-of-day format, file locks,
pipes, and many others.</p>
<p>The only advantage that this solution had over the previous one was
that the API layer could call the executive support layer with a known
set of parameter combinations. The executive support layer did not have
to deal with illegal parameter combinations.</p>
<p><strong>NT OS/2</strong> had to explore some new alternatives. What
we needed was a mechanism that would allow the OS/2 API layer to manage
and control all state for all of the OS/2 applications in the system,
and to allow the POSIX API layer to do the same for all of its
applications. It was this realization that brought us to the current
design strategy for <strong>NT OS/2</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="posix-and-os2-as-subsystems">7.3 POSIX and OS/2 as Subsystems
</h2>
<p>The system architecture chosen for <strong>NT OS/2</strong> allows it
to achieve its goals and, therefore, fulfill its mission. <strong>NT
OS/2</strong> is designed with a small, non-preemptible kernel, which
executes in kernel mode. A small but highly functional, preemptible,
interruptible, and reentrant executive, which also executes in kernel
mode and which exports a number of system service APIs, is layered on
top of the kernel.</p>
<p>The APIs exported by the executive do not implement either the OS/2
or POSIX API sets. Instead, they export a set of APIs that allow both an
OS/2 API set and a POSIX API set to be implemented entirely in user mode
as separate processes running as protected subsystems. Using this
approach, an OS/2 or POSIX API is emulated using the following
sequence:</p>
<p>o An application calls the local stub for an API function.</p>
<p>o The stub packages the arguments into a message and transmits the
message to either an OS/2 or POSIX subsystem using the <strong>NT
OS/2</strong> local procedure call mechanism.</p>
<p>o The subsystem receives the message, implements the API, and replies
to the application using LPC.</p>
<p>o The local stub receives the reply and returns the results to the
application.</p>
<p>The APIs exported by the <strong>NT OS/2</strong> executive are
powerful, but at the same time, are simple and straightforward. There
are no cases in which a single flag parameter changes the entire meaning
of an API. This design technique allows <strong>NT OS/2</strong> to
achieve its goals of robustness, extensibility, and maintainability.</p>
<p>Implementing OS/2 and POSIX as subsystems allows each subsystem to
implement only the set of semantics required by that subsystem. The
requirements of the subsystems do not translate into "tables off to the
side" or extra fields in data structures managed by the executive. When
a subsystem needs to keep track of additional state associated with an
object, it does so in its own data structures managed in the address
space of the subsystem. This technique leads to more elegant solutions
to problems posed by OS/2's process relationships or by POSIX's job
control data structures.</p>
<p>Rather than having to bypass most of the security features present in
<strong>NT OS/2</strong>, subsystems are able to use the security
features to their fullest extent. The security architecture, along with
the high performance LPC mechanism and powerful process structure and
memory management APIs allow the subsystems to increase the robustness,
extensibility and maintainability of the system while at the same time
decreasing the demands on system resources.</p>
